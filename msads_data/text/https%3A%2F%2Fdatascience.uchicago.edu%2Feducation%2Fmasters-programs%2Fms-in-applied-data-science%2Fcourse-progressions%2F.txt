competitive landscape of data science career paths with a focus on industry applications
. Full- and Part-time options are available in both the  
Online
 and 
In-Person
 formats. Full-time students take 3 classes per quarter (300 units). Part-time students take 2 classes per quarter (200 units).

A sample schedule for the MBA/MS can be found on the 
Booth website
.

Please note: Courses offerings are subject to change. The Pass/Fail, Career Seminar is a degree requirement for all students unless eligible to waive. There is no tuition or fees for the Career Seminar. Similarly, the optional Foundational noncredit courses are available at no additional cost.

Curriculum Details

The Master’s in Applied Data Science program offers two curriculum pathways: a 12-course program and an 18-course thesis track. Both include core courses, electives, a multi-quarter Capstone Project, and a required Career Seminar. The 18-course program includes additional electives and a thesis requirement. See below for a breakdown of each component.

Foundational Courses
 
(Optional, Noncredit)
:
Foundational noncredit courses are designed and taught by Master’s in Applied Data Science 
faculty and instructors
. These optional courses—available at no additional cost— provide the basis for the rigorous Applied Data Science degree. Course content undergirds the theoretical, strategic, and practical data science studies you will encounter in the rest of the curriculum.

Beginning in academic year 2024-25, all entering students will complete a required online Foundational Skills Assessment. This required assessment helps faculty and advisors understand how to best support you once you begin in the program. You may choose to opt-out of taking the Foundational Skill Assessments and instead register for all four Foundational courses. The four Foundational noncredit courses are listed below. Please note that Introduction to Statistical Concepts and R are considered pre-quarter courses and therefore take place during the 5 weeks leading up to your first quarter in the program. All Foundational courses are completed virtually for all students regardless of enrollment in the In-Person or Online Program.

Career Seminar
 
(Required, Noncredit)
:
A multi-quarter seminar focused on building real-world skills like communication, collaboration, and ethical problem-solving. Students with 3+ years of relevant full-time work experience may petition for a waiver.

Core Courses
:
All students complete 6 core courses that build theoretical understanding and teach students to apply data science methods to real-world problems.

Elective Courses
:
Students in the 12-course track complete 4 electives.
Students in the 18-course thesis track complete 8 electives and 2 independent study courses.
Past electives include topics like Generative AI Principles, Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing, Health Analytics, Supply Chain Optimization, and more.

Capstone Project
:
A required 2-quarter Capstone Project in which students work in teams to address a real industry or research problem. Full-time students typically begin Capstone in their third quarter; part-time students begin two quarters before graduation.

Core

 Statistical Models for Data Science 
Letter Grade

In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.

Core 

 Leadership and Consulting for Data Science 
Letter Grade

Professional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today’s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.
