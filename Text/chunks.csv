But data’s dynamics are complex and at their core is data’s mobility: it can move from one system, agent, or institution to another. Data’s promise and its puzzles lie in these dataflows and the ecology of structures and agents that produce and regulate them. Data ecology is not the product of technical systems, or social and financial incentives, or legal structures operating alone. It is shaped by those interrelated forces acting together and controlling it requires interdisciplinary tools drawn from a range of fields, including data science, law, economics, and the humanities.

Her earlier article Coordinated Rulemaking and Cooperative Federalism’s Administrative State , 132 Yale L.J. 1213 (2023), argues that cooperative federalism programs have given rise to a distinctive administrative state—with forms of administrative action and legal frameworks that diverge in important respects from ordinary federal and state administrative law. The Article illustrates this point by identifying a distinctive form of legislative rulemaking—“coordinated rulemaking”—which is widely used in cooperative federalism programs, but cannot be assimilated into familiar administrative law frameworks. Her article Data Federalism , 135 Harv. L.

The COVID-19 pandemic—and in particular society’s increasing reliance on reliable high-speed broadband Internet access during the crisis—has accelerated and magnified these existing disparities. As the essential tasks of living, such as learning, job seeking, and accessing health care move online, Internet access is increasingly an issue of educational equality and economic opportunity, one that disproportionately hurts low-income families and minorities. The lack of precise broadband deployment data complicates this issue: Historically, FCC broadband maps have often relied on census block data, which overestimates households with Internet access and lacks fine-grained detail. With a grant from data.org , our team innovated new, powerful data science approaches to gather and aggregate multiple data sources and enable the production of accurate broadband maps. We also created an Internet measurement and performance toolkit to allow policymakers, administrators, and the public to locate and understand the gaps in Internet coverage and target critical resource investments among communities most in need.",295b3545112034919a70037513af24c779fc826b17e2d98f592a0a158a755268

690699dd4f-0001,https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data4all/,Data4All High School Bridge Workshop,outreach,generic,,1,"In most Chicago Public High Schools (CPS), students’ exposure to computer science is limited to one computer science survey course, with limited exposure to advanced topics such as artificial intelligence, data science, or application of computer science to societal issues. This lack of opportunity continues to be perpetuated when students seek internships and other employment experiences and do not have the confidence in their own knowledge to see computer science, data science or artificial intelligence as a possible career pathway for themselves. To address this need, a team of researchers and educators from Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago developed a data science bridge workshop that supports students from Chicago’s South Side community to develop a deeper understanding of data science and grow a tangible skill set that is grounded in scientific projects, real-world datasets, and professional tools. Through this program students will explore the foundational concepts of computer science and data science, working with authentic and complex datasets and leveraging principles of AI to gain insights from data and make predictions. The workshop is taught by using case studies that contain a real-world scientific challenge (i.e. COVID-19), an authentic data set and associated professional tools. The case studies are supplied from data generated by scientific research projects from the three institutions.",a9f54624033e4dacc8b4ae704854d1f96cb150dc3324ffd664be1e26eee642bd

The datasets provide students with many of the challenges associated with scientific data and provide them with the skills to perform statistical analysis and prediction all the while exploring real-world problems. The workshop models the collaborative nature of computer science by situating students in teams with guidance and support of staff, including undergraduate and graduate mentors from the three institutions.

For Land Together , an organization in California that supports individuals transitioning back into the community, timing is everything. But until 2025, their work faced a technical bottleneck: to identify people scheduled for release, staff had to manually comb through the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) website—a process that could take days, and which often left them scrambling to provide support at the last minute. “We’d find out about a person’s release the day of, or the day before, giving us very little time to prepare, let alone connect with the person before they’re out,” explained Cindi Prado, Reentry Administrative Coordinator at Land Together. “It meant we were playing catch-up when we could have already been supporting someone.” Furthermore, the CDCR website was updated sporadically, such that by the time staff finished combing through it, their data was sometimes superseded by new information. With Land Together hoping to expand across California to serve more people, they knew their existing approach wouldn’t scale. * Land Together’s situation reflects a broader challenge many nonprofit organizations face: while the private sector has embraced automation and data analytics, many community-based organizations remain trapped in manual processes that consume precious staff time and limit their impact.",60f779c087e28ea1e1bde93d9b71240dd4c228ec70e40606181adc139f465057

There, Land Together’s team met with data scientists who recognized the challenge of tracking releases as one technology could readily solve. After working with the Land Together team to understand their workflow and needs, Trevor Spreadbury , a Software Engineer at the DSI, developed an automated web scraping solution that monitors the corrections department website and updates Land Together’s records with the latest data on program participants’ release date and timing. “The script runs automatically every night so each morning they have the most up to date information,” Spreadbury explained, adding, “It was important for the tool to be sustainable long term. From a technical perspective, the script is simple, extremely inexpensive, and has required no maintenance nearly a year in. From an operational perspective, it is incorporated directly into Land Together’s existing systems meaning their staff hasn’t had to learn new tools or worry about remembering some arcane set of steps. It gets that manual work out of the way so they can focus on providing direct support.” Now, “this scraper has saved so much time and is more accurate than what we did before,” said Prado.",87925c6a57a1266aab46b5b1ae2991ef9b0682e6a23684e2dfe5897aa7ce0061

By automating routine data collection, they can redirect human resources toward their core mission, particularly crucial for volunteer-driven organizations (Land Together was entirely volunteer-run until 2011), where every hour spent on manual data processing is an hour not spent providing direct services. The automated system doesn’t just save time; it enables the organization to be more responsive and proactive in their work: “[We] are now using the updated information in our participants’ files to generate reports about participants who have been found suitable at their parole hearing,” added Prado. “This has been extremely helpful!” Moreover, as Land Together expands their geographic reach, the technical solution scales with them. What might have required a dedicated team of volunteers and staff to monitor release data across counties can now be handled by updating a script. “Land Together’s challenge is a frequent one for nonprofits,” said Susan Paykin , Senior Associate Director of Community-Centered Data Science at the DSI. “These organizations often don’t have the same resources as industry, the same IT infrastructure or technical staff.",cd9d6110b5017c57ed7313ecd4c77e6996520849614ddedde7ac6b7c42149220

But that whirring is enabling pioneering work: for researchers across the University of Chicago, this GPU cluster is pushing the boundaries of knowledge across disciplines. From simulating thousands of years of weather systems in order to predict extreme climate events, to forging new ground in understanding human behavior, access to high-performance computing is letting researchers across campus tackle some of the world’s most complex research problems. But what exactly is a GPU cluster, and why does it matter? It’s a collection of interconnected computers each equipped with specialized processing units (GPUs) that work together as a single system to solve problems. Together, they can process massive datasets, run sophisticated machine learning models, and perform calculations that would take your typical laptop weeks or months to complete. “In launching the cluster, we hoped researchers would feel empowered to take on bigger and more complex questions than was previously possible,” said Mike Franklin , DSI Faculty Co-Director and Morton D.

Featured in major artificial intelligence conferences (including NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR) and high-impact journals (among them Physical Review B , Journal of Computational Physics, and SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science or SIMODS ) , some of this work is already influencing how we think about AI and research methodology across domains. Here’s a glimpse into the diversity of research across campus leveraging high-performance computing: In recent years, advances in computing have exponentially increased the possibilities of weather forecasts. Pedram Hassanzadeh , Associate Professor of Geophysical Sciences and Faculty Director of the AI for Climate Initiative, and his team are using the cluster to investigate how machine learning can improve weather forecasting to better understand and predict our changing climate. “The speed, storage, and staff support of this cluster allow us to bridge traditional atmospheric physics with cutting-edge machine learning approaches: we can train neural network-based atmospheric models on observations and high-resolution simulations, generate many weather realizations with them, and robustly study variability, especially that of extreme events,” said Hassanzadeh.",dce0389069d2a75bf368b5e1d23ae8fdd4ac1cd2bca2251c07c4a90605875d36

These approaches would have been prohibitively expensive just a few years ago.” By leveraging these computational advances, Hassanzadeh and his team are developing novel learning strategies to keep pace with climate change to predict and prepare for weather events. Historically, study of the brain was limited to relatively brief responses to stimuli, but computational advances have exploded the possibilities. YC Leong , Assistant Professor of Psychology and Director of the Motivation and Cognition Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Chicago said, “The DSI computing cluster has been transformative for our research. We are a computational cognitive neuroscience laboratory that studies how the brain processes complex, real-world experiences using full-length movies and TV episodes,” explained Leong. “The cluster allows us to integrate state-of-the-art vision and language models with massive fMRI datasets to predict how the brain responds to rich and naturalistic audiovisual content. No individual lab could maintain the level of storage and computational power needed to run these large-scale analyses.

Machine learning is also enabling more complex linguistic analysis than ever before. Chenhao Tan , Associate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science and his team are exploring applications across a range of disciplines. As just one example, Tan’s research group developed a framework for analyzing political discourse that makes concrete the uniquely divisive nature of presidential communication patterns. Their work was published in PNAS Nexus and recently referenced in The New York Times . “We needed to process and analyze massive datasets of human behavior drawn from millions of posts and notes across different data sources,” said Tan. “This kind of large-scale analysis of data simply wasn’t feasible before.

These experiences tend to stay with us for a long time, often becoming the milestones of our lives — and highly negative memories can also become intrusive, coming to mind vividly and unexpectedly. A new study published in Nature Human Behavior adds a new layer to our understanding of why emotional experiences are so sticky. The team, led by Psychology PhD student Jadyn Park, found that emotional arousal enhances memory encoding by strengthening cohesion across brain networks. Using fMRI during more natural, narrative settings, the researchers were able to track how emotional moments triggered a more “integrated” state in the brain, where different networks that usually play separate roles become more coordinated with one another. Most prior research on emotional memory has used relatively simple stimuli, exploring reactions to single words or static pictures. But in everyday life, Leong notes, our memories come from complex, unfolding experiences, similar to a movie or a story. To further existing work on memory, the researchers wanted to understand how emotional arousal shapes memory in more natural settings. They also wanted to look beyond individual brain regions, as prior studies focused heavily on areas like the amygdala and hippocampus.",392389cd7db9cdf7f27f846cd0a11423c47e1f7db5a3bb748a6126607aa01717

The study combined existing fMRI datasets across institutions and sites to create a large sample. This brain imaging method allows researchers to measure the whole brain at once, giving them a more comprehensive picture of the areas and connections stimulated as study participants watched movie clips and listened to stories. The researchers used three different methods to determine how emotionally salient various naturalistic stimuli were. They asked people to subjectively rate how emotionally arousing a particular scene was, they used a large language model to gauge how arousing scenes were, and they measured people’s pupil dilation as a physiological measure of arousal. The researchers used the mathematical framework of graph theory to show that emotion strengthens memory by changing how the whole brain works together, versus just individual parts The team found that when participants were watching highly arousing scenes, the brain shifted into a more integrated state. In turn, this increased integration predicted how well people then remembered the scene. “Think of the brain as an orchestra made up of many different sections. Sometimes they play separately, and other times they come together in harmony — what we call an integrated state,” Leong explains.",083cf65d8f5b43d33b8d7a62faed104963b434bd317e69c607946fe7facb7bf3

The findings could lead to medical interventions that could make memories more or less sticky. By stimulating or suppressing the parts of the brain network that function as the “bridges,” there’s an opportunity to increase or decrease the level of integration in the brain that strengthens memory. “We found that when participants are experiencing these highly emotional events, diverse brain regions tend to be more coordinated with one another, or are more integrated,” Park says. “If we can deliberately disrupt or enhance that integration, it may open the door to interventions that help weaken traumatic memories.” More practically, the study offers a new set of tools to probe memories in different ways. It marks a major step in allowing researchers to better measure what makes emotional memories sticky.",49f8c95cbaece522b92e95045dd02a0e980404ca93f06cf8158d5a4225b980cf

But when it comes to 4-digit multiplication, a task taught in elementary school, even state-of-the-art systems fail. Why? A new paper by Computer Science PhD student Xiaoyan Bai and Faculty Co-Director of the Novel Intelligence Research Initiative Chenhao Tan , along with collaborators from MIT, Harvard, University of Waterloo, and Google DeepMind, reverse-engineers failure and success to find answers. As you may remember (or have forgotten), multiplying larger numbers requires carrying over digits, and mentally “holding on” to partial products so you can add them up to get your final product. Processes that require storing information for later use in this way are called “long-range dependencies.” Standard models work by learning to recognize patterns in the data they’re trained on. But the more complex a problem gets, the less likely a model is to have seen it specifically. So how do you teach a model to not just memorize answers but learn a process ? Models are often taught new tasks via standard fine-tuning (SFT), which relies on scaling up the training data, or adding more steps or “layers.” But even when the research team tested models with 2 layers all the way up to 12 layers, they all achieved less than 1% accuracy on 4×4 digit multiplication.",a0bf27ec7ad3e81821ed03957d58b71015038fa05f1c3639d25b76a68c2ccde2

The researchers found that under the SFT approach with gradient descent (an iterative optimization algorithm), models converge to a “local optimum:” the best solution in a given dataset. However, this approach doesn’t account for those long-range dependencies. The problem isn’t lack of training, the team found. Rather, the model is trapped: without an architecture that lets it store and retrieve intermediate information, it can’t step beyond that local optimum, no matter how long it trains, or how large it scales. Next, the researchers identified a model trained using a different method: Implicit Chain of Thought (ICoT). Where SFT achieved less than 1% accuracy, the ICoTmodel was able to achieve 100% accuracy. To understand what this approach was doing differently, the team took both apart to uncover some fundamental insights: The ICoT model learns to remember what matters . Unlike the SFT model, the ICoT model learned to track those “long-range dependencies.” The team verified this by testing whether they could decode intermediate values (like running sums) from the models’ internal states. In the ICoT model, they could; in the standard model, they couldn’t. The ICoT method gradually removes intermediate reasoning steps during training, in a sense forcing the model to internalize the reasoning process in its hidden states rather than relying on explicit step-by-step tokens. The ICoT model organizes its attention into branches across time.",92ee50a82cb33db18f109b3bf55a0baad225192ded71b31de9f2506c890cc064

In later layers, it retrieves exactly the “cached” products needed for each output digit. This creates an efficient directed graph for implementing the multiplication algorithm, a structure the standard model never develops. Mathematics rendered in geometric form : Perhaps most remarkably, the model represents digits and their operations using elegant mathematical structures. Digits are encoded using wave-like patterns (Fourier bases) that form a pentagonal prism shape in the model’s internal representation space. When multiplying digit pairs, the model uses a natural geometric operation called a Minkowski sum, which notably wasn’t programmed by the researchers, but rather emerged naturally during training in the ICoT model. It’s as if the successful model derived its own efficient mathematical language for arithmetic. If the SFT models’ struggle with long-range dependencies was about missing inductive biases, then providing the right training signal should fix it. To validate their understanding, the team introduced a simple solution: they added an “auxiliary loss” that trains lightweight linear probes to predict running sums at each step, capturing and carrying intermediate values and partial products. It turned out that making this one addition to the 2-layer model that completely failed under standard training did the trick. The result: 99% accuracy without explicit chain-of-thought supervision.",53a23a2aa1b6eb79e98aa28efd0fe99155e0c126ba5167948cbbf10fca0f0333

While multiplication might seem a specific kind of task, the findings illuminate fundamental aspects of how transformers learn and “think.” The long-range dependency problem isn’t unique to arithmetic; it appears throughout language modeling and other sequential tasks, and demonstrates AI’s “jagged frontier,” that is, its capacity to excel at complex reasoning, yet stumble on seemingly simple tasks. The team’s approach asks foundational questions about the distinctions between memorization and learning, and what architectural constraints help or hinder models’ performance. “As AI is increasingly integrated into critical decision-making, it’s essential to understand its unique ways of learning and thinking,” said Tan. “Our research is trying to chart that terrain.” This paper’s key contribution: architectural insights and training techniques can overcome obstacles that scaling alone cannot address. The right inductive biases, not just more parameters or data, are key to pushing AI capabilities forward. While the auxiliary loss solution is task-specific, the researchers anticipate future work will develop more general approaches to improve learning on tasks requiring long-range dependencies.",229f03af0941c8631c2e42c91bcd1fb838e96542a16b8d0cc574d3e0f7fb06a6

A common ref rain these days is to ‘just ask AI’—but can AI reliably forecast the future? Haifeng Xu , Assistant Profess or of Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Chicago and the Data Science Institute, and his team at the Strategic IntelliGence for Machine Agents (SIGMA) Lab are trying to answer this question. They recently launched Prophet Arena , a benchmarking tool that evaluates large language models’ (LLMs) intelligence through real-world forecasting. For those unfamiliar, this arena is “a platform where people can measure how clever or intelligent the language models are,” Xu explains. In 2023, when the platform Chatbot Arena was launched, we witnessed the power of crowdsourced evaluation: the wildly popular platform run by LMSYS has collected over 800,000 votes from millions of users comparing language models in head-to-head comparisons, or “battles.” First developed by researchers at UC Berkeley, Chatbot Arena revolutionized AI evaluation by moving beyond academic benchmarks to capture real-world human preferences in smooth, “humanlike” communication. But when groups like the Center for AI Safety and ScaleAI’s have created standardized tests for AI (e.g., ‘Humanity’s Last Exam,’ ), even the most advanced LLMs have flopped. This inconsistent performance across different measures of intelligence–that models could perform well on some benchmarks yet fail dramatically on others–was a key motivation behind Prophet Arena.",833330fae6ca84ce95864469f3bc180d54e8c04d7eb330c149d24d6804185e75

Now, Prophet Arena is bringing the “arena” concept into the realm of forecasting to craft a better benchmark of intelligence. Where Chatbot Arena asked “which response do humans prefer?” Prophet Arena asks, “Which model makes the best prophet?” Forecasting the future demands sophisticated capabilities that are fundamental to how we as humans reason about the world: understanding existing information, thinking critically about its reliability, calibrating for news sources, integrating different perspectives, and synthesize everything into their forecast. Prophet Arena challenges LLMs to focus on these capabilities, making general-purpose forecasts across domains without specialized fine-tuning. Traditional AI benchmarks rely on fixed datasets with known answers. As Xu explains, “Frontier models are trained on every possible piece of data these days, so gradually, they’ll memorize the answers to any static benchmark,” also called overfitting. “They might be able to ace a sophisticated exam, but they still won’t be able to reason accurately in the wild.” So the team considered a different approach: “If you ask a model to forecast the future, which is dynamic,” Xu explains, “you won’t run into that problem. Unless you can bend time, you’ll never overfit the future.",71b5b175a85f0dcd392f1331322a882caa2751b5df09b62126df3b02852b14cd

The platform uses a three-stage pipeline: Information Sourcing : The platform gathers news reports across domains like politics, economics, science, and sports, and market data (specifically high trade volume and liquidity from the prediction market Kalshi ) in order to curate events of interest . Forecast Submission : Rather than requiring simple yes/no answers, Prophet Arena elicits probabilistic distributions from AI models, allowing them to express confidence levels and uncertainty. Along with their structured forecasts with probability distributions, models include detailed rationales. Until an event takes place, models continue to integrate developments in events and sentiments into its understanding and assessment of the evolving landscape. Outcome Resolution : Each of these forecasts ladders up to an overall evaluation of model performance: the platform uses a combination of established and novel metrics that each measure different aspects of performance that together “provide a more complete picture of what makes a model a good prophet” for a given issue, says Xu. “You can think of it like an IQ test for LLMs.” As each event resolves in real-time, a live leaderboard tracks developments in model performance in real time.",e473c39004ce38141af6a1f97716f21d53a36b57df80a067041c0d93430029df

Say, for example, you want to explore the likelihood national gas prices will pass $3.25 this month. On Prophet Arena, you can explore not just what major LLMs have to say about the odds, but how contextual factors influence their reasoning. Designed to facilitate collaboration between humans and AI, the interface documents the sources considered and explains the reasoning behind different weights or decisions made in the model. Further, users can adjust forecasts based on their personal risk tolerance, from completely risk-neutral to highly risk-averse. The interface also allows users to log in to rate forecasts and compare source quality to help models learn which sources are more reliable, and explore how forecasts change with new information. The idea is that the interface can facilitate collaboration between AI and humans, supporting multi-step reasoning for the model and inviting humans to question their assumptions. We know that LLMs handle the same inputs differently based on their respective training. Prophet Arena is showing us how: models exhibit distinct reasoning styles or “personas” in their approaches. For example, in forecasting whether AI regulation will become federal law before 2026, models show dramatically different confidence levels (ranging from 35% to 75%) despite analyzing the same legislative developments. “Some models are very critical, and some trust all news sources absolutely,” Xu explains. “The more advanced models tend to be more hesitant rather than completely trusting.",c138559bcf96dcd93605c28b926eeb22dd92e019f7bc93ebbf8e0bd988a259ad

In one case, o3-mini identified Toronto Football Club as having a 30% chance of winning, while the market priced it at only 11%, ultimately earning a 9x return when Toronto won the upset victory. Right now, you can use the platform to explore questions from “Who will win this year’s Nobel Peace Prize?” to “How likely is it that AI regulation becomes federal law this year?” Other questions you can investigate with Prophet Arena range from fun to serious: Which films are most likely to receive Oscar nominations for Best Picture? How likely is a recession this year? Which vaccines are likely to see their recommendations ended in the US this year? Xu’s vision extends further: “Our single greatest vision is to democratize forecasting,” he says. “While prediction is fundamental to human activity, it’s difficult for most people to do. But armed with LLMs that can combine many people’s opinions, and communicate their reasoning, more people can access these tools to help them plan ahead.” The platform’s next priority is increasing user engagement, because as forecasting becomes more accessible, it also creates a virtuous cycle: more participation improves the forecasts, and better forecasts attract more users.",753333e2b1a904da27b92802a0774758a2f8ae4066f53135e8e83e03b544e3a2

The first concerns the search for singularities in fluid equations (Wang-Lai-Gómez-Serrano-Buckmaster, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2023). The second application uses PDE-constrained NNs as an inverse method in geophysics (Wang, Lai et al., Science 2025). Whether an incompressible fluid can develop singularities in finite time is an open question in mathematical fluid dynamics. Unstable singularities, especially in dimensions greater than 1, are exceptionally elusive. We employ NNs to hunt for singularities, both stable and unstable ones, for the incompressible 3-dimensional Euler equations and other fluid equations. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss how the same NNs method trained with real world data can help uncover the constitutive laws of glacial ice, which differ from commonly assumed forms in conventional models. Both examples illustrate how deep learning can help facilitate new discoveries.",dc886a3ead22abb1fd0e73765217f1117182cfa7c6615c050fc53540f238ef42

Abstract: “Life” and “intelligence” are terms with heavily contested meanings. This talk will present a novel perspective on both, beginning with the surprising observation, first made by von Neumann around 1950, that general computation is at the heart of any living system. Experiments in artificial life (ALife) have now allowed us to observe the emergence of life from random initial conditions (abiogenesis), in the process suggesting a central role in evolution for “symbiogenesis,” the symbiotic merger of existing replicators to form novel ones. When computational entities enter into symbiotic relationships, they must model each other, and when they merge, computational parallelism enables them to become both more complex to model and more powerful as modelers. The ensuing “intelligence explosion” feedback dynamics are familiar to evolutionary neurobiologists who have explored the relationships between troop size and brain scaling among highly social animals, including hominins.",bcd33f7bdbf650dc0973aa3ac53c72e41c94d04be8b6ad7cc81a9be146dc92f0

These requests are processed through Uber’s algorithm, which must consider thousands of variables, from driver locations that update in real-time to surge pricing calculations that change based on current demand, to determine a match between driver and rider. In sharp contrast to static data, which resides in a dataset and remains unchanged from day to day, Uber’s algorithm is a prime example of streaming data, in which queries are submitted in real-time and an answer must reflect the newest and most updated information at hand. 20 years ago, data infrastructure was typically built to handle static data, and those that needed to be “streamed” were updated periodically, in a process known as batch processing. However, this turned out to be a problem for time-sensitive information, such as when trading in the stock market or analyzing whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. How can an algorithm make accurate decisions when the data is more than a day old? A steep drop in market prices, or a stolen credit card, could have easily occurred within that window and altered how an algorithm makes a decision, creating significant delays that generated a lot of frustration for data scientists.

Simultaneously, researchers at MIT and Brown were doing the same thing. Their respective systems, along with the papers detailing them, were released in the early 2000s at the Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) and earned both groups the prestigious Test of Time award in 2025. “Research is often very ‘fad’-driven. People get excited about an idea and produce a lot of research relating to it, so a lot of the content in these conferences, and the Best Paper Award, is all in the moment,” Franklin states. “The idea behind the Test of Time award is that, looking back ten or 20 years from now, you gain a perspective on what work has lasting importance. So, it’s a real honor, because this is something that is given with a good deal of context and time that has gone by. We were very happy to receive this.” In their paper, TelegraphCQ: Continuous Dataflow Processing for an Uncertain World , Franklin and his colleagues built off an existing system called Telegraph (named after Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley). The original Telegraph system was not designed for continuous data processing in real-time, so they expanded its capabilities to handle continuous queries — hence the addition of “CQ” to the name.",29efc0f64a72d9474fffee91af60b602887333b1f57f83165d7d724c02c4e059

In contrast, the MIT/Brown paper created a brand new system and interface language, which required more coding effort and a steeper learning curve for users. “We broke fewer things,” Franklin reflects. “PostgreSQL has turned out to be by far the most popular of open source database systems so we were way ahead of our time. It was a natural choice for usbecause it came out of Berkeley, so we knew the people who built it originally. We extended an existing database system instead of building everything brand new, and we used as much as we could.” While some of the TelegraphCQ design decisions proved to be prescient, others were perhaps a bit too radical. For example, TelegraphCQ implemented a novel and aggressive form of adaptive query optimization. In a traditional database system, a query is written in SQL and compiled into an internal program before returning the answer. During this compilation process, the program analyzes all the different ways to get an answer and returns the most efficient one, based on different assumptions about the data and what will be done with it. In TelegraphCQ, they took an adaptive approach. As the data is constantly changing in real time, the most efficient query method is also altered on the fly, such that the chosen method is never constant as a query progresses. This created a few problems, including a degree of performance unpredictability beyond what is preferred for many real-world applications.",d7e48f71e79cfe8c5738c7812b3dc6bc6788b889d3c0ae211f907da9dc4799f2

In hindsight, there was not a huge market at the time for a continuous database system because companies and organizations that were using a lot of data had already streamlined their business processes around batch processing, in which they wait overnight to update the database and receive answers the next day. Most business processes at the time were not built to react immediately to new and constantly updated information, except for specific use-cases like credit card fraud detection, where hand-coded solutions had already been created for that purpose. Now, businesses are catching up. In addition to the competitive advantage of being able to process data at a greater pace than a competitor can, the introduction of AI has made continuous processing an even more important feature.

This breakthrough promises to extend accurate forecasting to regions that have historically lacked access to advanced technologies. A collaboration of researchers from the University of Chicago and Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), supported by the Agricultural Innovation Mechanism for Scale (AIM for Scale), are working to ensure that governments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can adopt these innovations early and build world class national services—delivering services once limited to places like the US, EU, or Japan. “AI weather models are revolutionizing what can be done with forecasts, but because they are a new type of technology, governments often lack the training, hardware, and institutional capacity to build and use them effectively.

Their first cohort—from Bangladesh, Chile, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria—are being trained September 22-26 in the UAE, hosted by MBZUAI and the National Center of Meteorology. In the years ahead, additional rounds will expand to 25 more countries–reaching a total of 30 and further broadening reach and impact to potentially millions more farmers. AIM for Scale is working on the ground with development partners to ensure this effort is scalable, inclusive, and delivers real impact for farmers. “Accurate, high-quality forecasts can unlock better yields, higher incomes, and stronger livelihoods for farmers,” says Paul Winters, Executive Director of AIM for Scale and Professor of Global Affairs at the University of Notre Dame’s Keough School of Global Affairs. “By pairing AI innovation with practical agricultural decision-making, we’re creating opportunities for millions of farmers to prosper.” Fundamental to the program, the team is engaging ministries of agriculture to ensure forecasts can be tailored to the needs of smallholder farmers who are most vulnerable to",900e838694c82288b8a6c7b7aebfabe56b93711d1a02c3631b8ce2cd48176fb5

The power of AI is not only in extending access to the types of gold-standard forecasts available in the world’s most well-resourced NMHSs, but also in enabling those forecasts to be generated directly “in-house” by NMHSs at lower cost and with greater accuracy on timelines–from days to weeks—that matter most for farm management. For example, advanced knowledge of the start of the rainy season can help farmers plan what crops to plant and when. Equally important, however, are reliable short-term forecasts that guide day-to-day decisions about irrigation, fertilizer use, or labor. By partnering with ministries of agriculture, a feedback loop can be created: ministries help inform and guide model development to ensure forecasts meet needs on the ground, while improved forecasts in turn guide farmers to make more impactful decisions. “From weather data to model verification and downscaling, this training covers the key dimensions of AI-powered weather forecasting that enable farmers to plan under uncertainty,” says Souhaib Ben Taieb, Associate Professor of Statistics and Data Science at MBZUAI. ”It demonstrates how frontier AI research can translate into practical solutions for global challenges like food security.” The training combines technical expertise with hands-on capacity building, giving national meteorological teams the tools and autonomy to generate and deliver tailored forecasts and ensuring this information reaches farmers.

In a world transforming rapidly through computing, data, and now AI, fluency in computational thinking and data literacy will be increasingly essential to forming individuals who are educated questioners and lifelong learners. “If the University’s duty is to ‘sustain inquiry and training into all things that touch on human existence,’ then equipping students to reason about data, algorithms, and their social meaning follows naturally from that duty.” As advances in computing unlock advances in fields from medicine to climate science , and as inquiry into writing , communication , and social choice shapes our interactions with AI, investment across humanities and data science “is not a zero-sum choice; it is the holistic view of rigorous inquiry that Chicago has always championed.” Read more at The Chicago Maroon here .",2e67bbee0ce3a552710dbdf0ea80f5fcc372753be58edf6a7a2c47e04b794b6f

Information is not represented solely by average firing rates but by the precise timing and coordination of spikes. Using two complementary approaches, examining a canonical computation in mouse visual cortex and training spiking neural network (SNN) models constrained by the statistical features of cortical connectivity and spiking dynamics, we identify shared dynamical principles by which inhibition enables spike-based computation. In vivo , divisive normalization, a canonical cortical operation, reflects transient modulation of inhibitory neuron activity driven by the temporal structure of subcortical input. Across neurons, normalization strength varies systematically with heterogeneity in excitatory–inhibitory balance and moment-to-moment coupling within local populations, indicating that computation arises from dynamic coordination within recurrent networks. In parallel, task-trained SNNs, push–pull inhibitory motifs emerge with training and maintain opponent balance between excitatory and inhibitory units.",a3e53fb820783751d953cfbc3965fea8e63e567e78c991f525e73308be23a381

Disrupting spike timing by only a few milliseconds, or relaxing biological realism, significantly impairs task performance, underscoring the causal role of temporal precision and dynamically evolving inhibition in recurrent information processing. Together, these results demonstrate that the cortex computes through continuously evolving spike interactions that reconfigure excitatory–inhibitory coupling over time. This framework unifies canonical operations such as normalization with emergent circuit motifs in trained spiking networks, providing a mechanistic link between biological and artificial systems that compute with spikes.

Launched in September 2024, this interdisciplinary effort combines climate physics, computer science, economics, applied and computational math, statistics, public health, and the social sciences to pioneer new models for climate and weather prediction and to inform global efforts on adaptation and resilience. “AICE is among the first of its kind at a university,” said Pedram Hassanzadeh , Faculty Director of AICE and an Associate Professor of Geophysical Sciences and Computational and Applied Mathematics. “Other programs typically have a narrower scope that’s either limited to one or two disciplines or centered solely on deep learning applications as a new tool. By building a wide coalition of researchers, including those focused on socioeconomic impacts and adaptation and mitigation strategies, our program is helping position the University of Chicago as a leader in this space.” A joint program of UChicago’s Data Science Institute and the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth , AICE has already notched several early successes that have helped advance its mission to revolutionize and democratize climate science and weather forecasting.

A properly trained high school student with a laptop can now produce state-of-the-art forecasts, though they would need help interpreting them.” This shift has profound implications for many around the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), which often lack access to high-performance computing but face acute risks from extreme heat and other climate impacts. “There is an urgent need for innovative solutions to address the growing impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities,” said Amir Jina, who co-leads AICE with Hassanzadeh. Jina is a development economist at the Harris School of Public Policy. “Our research has demonstrated that countries have an opportunity to better protect their economies from climate uncertainties by improving weather forecasting.” For example, research conducted by Jina and colleagues has shown that improved monsoon forecasts help farmers make better decisions—such as how much to plant, what to plant, or whether to plant at all—ultimately leading to smarter investments and greater resilience.",c6d74b8d77cdd42b681e206e8a3c255ed7fb615af942e8a83095f069556d2c79

At COP29 , the UN’s most recent climate change conference, AIM for Scale announced a $1 billion package to boost weather services for farmers in LMICs, which included funding to support a research and training program led by AICE. AICE is developing state-of-the-art AI models and training government officials—initially from 30 countries in the tropics and global south—on how to use them effectively, in partnership with the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in the United Arab Emirates. Focus on the Long Term AICE also aims to improve its AI models for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) weather forecasts. Current AI models outperform the physics-based models for 1- to 10-day forecasts, but like the physics-based models, do not offer much skill beyond these lead times. However, longer range forecasts, from around two weeks to 6 weeks, offer valuable climate insights and decision-making opportunities that shorter ones cannot, such as helping farmers to make strategic decisions on such concerns as crop planning, resource use, and risk management well in advance.",bb19ca588cf55e578e948f68848124f88a15a605efdaab2ee86f08ebad90538b

In fact, just recently, Hassanzadeh and colleagues showed the challenges of AI models with the rarest, most extreme weather events , so-called “gray swans,” calling for innovation at the intersection of AI, mathematics, and climate physics, one of the major goals of AICE. With these limitations in mind, researchers at AICE are working to benchmark and better understand AI climate emulators, testing how well their predictions match reality and where they fall short, to ensure they’re both fast and trustworthy. Such work can pinpoint where new innovations are needed to build better physics-informed AI tools for the next-generation of weather and climate modeling. This work, while in its infancy, holds the potential to democratize access to climate projections much in the same way AI can for weather forecasting. “If we can demonstrate that these emulators show considerable skill and reliability for rare and extreme events or for weather pattern changes, and build up a group who know how to use them, that could be transformative,” said Tiffany Shaw , Director of AICE and Professor of Geophysical Science. “That’s the real opportunity for AI tools like this – bringing new knowledge to more people who can use it to make strategic decisions while reducing the uncertainties we currently face.” Research Initiative AICE: AI for Climate Campus News Sep 03, 2025 A Bet Worth Placing: Computing and Data Science at UChicago DSI News Sep 23, 2025 Weather Forecasting T",e5ffdf8d19a7ab3553ce2982f6554f8d32183d44fbf38e9444ba22c8ef560ca7

A Game-Theoretic Notion of Evidence and Cooperative Skepticism,insights,generic,,0,"Much of scientific discovery—be it the existence of a new particle or the effectiveness of a new cancer treatment—directly relies on a quantified notion of evidence obtained from data. Yet, the most widespread notion of evidence, known as the p-value , has a number of issues. The p-value is easy to misuse and hard to understand; further, combining different p-values is generally difficult. So, is there an alternative that can avoid these issues? It turns out that there is a promising alternative based on game-theoretic ideas, called the e-value . After reviewing this game-theoretic notion of evidence, I will introduce my recent work , joint with Aaditya Ramdas (Carnegie Mellon University), where we develop a general approach to combining game-theoretic evidence in the challenging case of asymmetric information. Given a null hypothesis (for example, that a drug has no effect on a health outcome), how do we quantify the evidence against it based on observed data? In classical hypothesis testing, we typically compute a p-value, which is a number between 0 and 1 that is unlikely to be small (say, less than 0.05) if the null hypothesis is true. If we observe a small p-value, we take it as evidence that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true. While mathematically sound, this complicated and indirect definition of a p-value is arguably the culprit for many instances of “p-hacking” in scientific research.",95dc765f60c543977ae3a6e8367bf6e10c0ced7ef773b39e9d73f5e27b60a00f

A Game-Theoretic Notion of Evidence and Cooperative Skepticism,insights,generic,,1,"In search of a more intuitive and robust notion of evidence, some statisticians have revisited a centuries-old idea underlying probability theory and statistics: the idea of understanding probabilities through betting games . In the resulting framework known as testing-by-betting , we cast a hypothesis testing problem as a perfect-information game, in which the null hypothesis corresponds to a probability (or a family of probabilities) proposed by a bookmaker. For example, a null hypothesis saying “this coin is fair” can be viewed as a bookmaker proposing equal odds on either side of the coin. Next, a skeptic can play this game by betting their money on it. For example, the skeptic may have doubts that the coin is biased towards heads, so they may choose to bet repeatedly a fraction of their budget on heads. Over repeated rounds of the game, the skeptic’s wealth (relative to their initial wealth) directly captures the evidence against the null hypothesis: the more wealth they accumulate, the more evidence the skeptic has against the coin being fair (see Figures 1 & 2). The skeptic’s accumulated wealth in this game is called an e-value , short for “evidence value”, or simply a betting score . Figure 1: In a roulette table, a gambler who believes that the odds are higher for the ball to land on red may choose to repeatedly bet on red, and make money if they are right. Analogously in testing-by-betting, a skeptic who is doubtful of the proposed null hypothesis may repeatedly bet against it, and their resulting wealth quantifies evidence against the null.",c290fdb6684c6df41d6a65ba638b599c6356ee7f78f6caa2e60cb7939d5cf3ef

A Game-Theoretic Notion of Evidence and Cooperative Skepticism,insights,generic,,2,"The larger the wealth, the less likely it is that the null is true. (Photo: Wikipedia ) Figure 2: As more data is observed, an e-value remains small (less than one) when the data is generated from a null distribution; it can grow large when the data is instead simulated from an alternative. Here, e-values are computed using the aGRAPA method . In recent years, a growing number of statisticians have advocated for the use of e-values over p-values. Unlike p-values, e-values have the “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” property: if I observed an e-value of 100 using the data, then effectively I was able to multiply my wealth 100 (!) times by betting against the odds put forth by the null hypothesis. This is quite an unlikely outcome unless the null hypothesis was wrong. In the betting view, it is also easier to intuitively capture the size of an e-value; in contrast, it is not obvious how to compare p-values of, say, 0.002 and 0.01, not to mention the fuzzy meaning of a large p-value of, say, 0.37. E-values thus help alleviate dichotomous thinking, which contributes to the “replication crisis” in science . Aside from their intuitive appeal, e-values offer (at least) two tangible benefits. First, e-values allow for anytime-valid inference in sequential experiments: even when we choose to stop the experiment after observing some data points, the resulting e-value is a statistically valid measure of evidence at that data-dependent sample size.",5ef6a2307c2834f929395f00b5cfe3c1d06c00c785186ad7641fc0da0d84ff21

A Game-Theoretic Notion of Evidence and Cooperative Skepticism,insights,generic,,3,"This allows the experimenter to avoid a major cause of p-hacking, namely when researchers “fish” for a small enough p-value by collecting more data until they find one (known as optional stopping ; you will surely run into a false positive this way). Second, generally speaking, e-values can be combined seamlessly via averaging, even when they are arbitrarily dependent; our recent work closely examines this characteristic of e-values. Advancing this exciting frontier of statistics, our recent work ( Choe & Ramdas, 2024 ) develops a general approach to combining e-values when the evidence is obtained sequentially from asymmetric information sources . Recent work has shown that we can design e-values for complex families of null hypotheses, e.g., for sequentially testing whether the data is random and whether the input and output of the data are statistically independent . These can be important diagnostic tests when building machine learning models that rely on such assumptions (or the lack thereof). For these complex hypotheses, a popular strategy for designing powerful e-values is to limit the information available to the skeptic. However, when using this strategy, the “anytime-validity” of the resulting e-value can be quite subtle. In particular, this limited-information e-value is not valid at data-dependent sample sizes, and thus it cannot be readily combined with other e-values (that are anytime-valid). More generally, if two skeptics play the game with asymmetric information sets, then their resulting wealth cannot be combined as seamlessly as usual.",0a0cb4cad1a3d1c3a6fc29cb762a5f7bdd96b33a9c740ae00ac05c45d470f0c3

A Game-Theoretic Notion of Evidence and Cooperative Skepticism,insights,generic,,4,"To address this challenge, we make two main contributions in our recent work: We propose a general approach to combining e-values obtained across different information sets using adjusters , which are functions that transform an e-value that is only valid under a restricted set of information to one that is valid under full information (the data). In particular, using an adjuster ensures that the combined e-value is valid at data-dependent sample sizes (see Figure 3). We show how using adjusters can be necessary for ensuring the validity of the combined e-value, in the case of asymmetric information. The approach is applicable to any e-values for complex hypotheses in sequential experiments. Figure 3: For complex hypotheses like “data is random”, an unadjusted e-value may lack validity at data-dependent sample sizes (yellow; many e-values exceed 1), preventing it from being combined with other e-values via averaging. Applying an adjuster resolves this issue (green). The plot shows e-values computed over 100 repeated simulations of random data; dots indicate the final (data-dependent) sample size in each run. We broadly refer to the overall process of combining e-values as cooperative skepticism , as it involves pooling evidence from multiple skeptics who each play the game having different information sets. As adjusters incur a relatively small loss of evidence and a negligible computational cost, they can be used in any (sequential) hypothesis testing scenario where the e-value is only valid under limited information.",ebf2386274e594e342532209be190a45da811dd026a3f05dc8e5be15afe01b00

We know biological systems adapt to their environment by changing their behavior in response to past events as captured by the saying, once bitten, twice shy. In the brain, for instance, neurons wire together if they fire together. But the ability to learn is not limited to sentient or animate beings; it can emerge in natural physical processes. Inanimate systems can also evolve their microscopic interactions to effectively learn desired behaviors after experiencing examples of that behavior, a phenomenon referred to previously as physical learning. So far, physical learning has been applied to learn static properties, such as to achieving a material with desired mechanical properties or recalling certain self-assembled structures.",43e9da448221af6f8f78e165dadbc708509087ba292cc17387c90d7d80ebd0d2

The essence of our approach is conceptualized schematically in Fig.1: an external agent first imposes a dynamic state that breaks time-reversal symmetry on the system during a period called training (e.g. moves the wings of the origami bird in Fig.1a). (Refer to the video demonstration ). Note we say that a process has time reversal symmetry if a recording of the process looks similar whether it is played forward or in reverse. Next, during a period known as retrieval, the desired time-dependent state (e.g. wings flapping) can be recovered as the system evolves according to interactions learned during the training (Fig.1b). In our paper, we identify the two ingredients needed to learn time-dependent behaviors that are common across all experimental platforms: (i) learning rules that are dependent on the history of the training process and (ii) exposure to examples that break time-reversal symmetry during training. After providing a hands-on demonstration of these requirements using programmable LEGO toys, we turn to realistic particle-based simulations (refer to the video demonstration ). Instead of programming the training rules by hand, we explain how they emerge from simple physico-chemical processes involving the causal propagation of chemical fields released and sensed by these particles. This rich phenomenology is captured by a modified spin model amenable to analytical treatment.",da39460495e3d771b0ec73d2a1a5ce709cacd056c9624dfdb1658eeb512f7060

This strategy can not only be applied in robotic matter by directly programming a computer, but also in physico-chemical active matter systems where the process of learning naturally emerges. The principles illustrated here provide a step towards von Neumann ‘s dream of engineering synthetic systems with life-like behaviors and shed light on how artificial life itself may originate from primitive components capable of adapting to their environment.

These experiences tend to stay with us for a long time, often becoming the milestones of our lives — and highly negative memories can also become intrusive, coming to mind vividly and unexpectedly. A new study published in Nature Human Behavior adds a new layer to our understanding of why emotional experiences are so sticky. The team, led by Psychology PhD student Jadyn Park, found that emotional arousal enhances memory encoding by strengthening cohesion across brain networks. Using fMRI during more natural, narrative settings, the researchers were able to track how emotional moments triggered a more “integrated” state in the brain, where different networks that usually play separate roles become more coordinated with one another. Most prior research on emotional memory has used relatively simple stimuli, exploring reactions to single words or static pictures. But in everyday life, Leong notes, our memories come from complex, unfolding experiences, similar to a movie or a story. To further existing work on memory, the researchers wanted to understand how emotional arousal shapes memory in more natural settings. They also wanted to look beyond individual brain regions, as prior studies focused heavily on areas like the amygdala and hippocampus.",392389cd7db9cdf7f27f846cd0a11423c47e1f7db5a3bb748a6126607aa01717

The study combined existing fMRI datasets across institutions and sites to create a large sample. This brain imaging method allows researchers to measure the whole brain at once, giving them a more comprehensive picture of the areas and connections stimulated as study participants watched movie clips and listened to stories. The researchers used three different methods to determine how emotionally salient various naturalistic stimuli were. They asked people to subjectively rate how emotionally arousing a particular scene was, they used a large language model to gauge how arousing scenes were, and they measured people’s pupil dilation as a physiological measure of arousal. The researchers used the mathematical framework of graph theory to show that emotion strengthens memory by changing how the whole brain works together, versus just individual parts The team found that when participants were watching highly arousing scenes, the brain shifted into a more integrated state. In turn, this increased integration predicted how well people then remembered the scene. “Think of the brain as an orchestra made up of many different sections. Sometimes they play separately, and other times they come together in harmony — what we call an integrated state,” Leong explains.",083cf65d8f5b43d33b8d7a62faed104963b434bd317e69c607946fe7facb7bf3

The findings could lead to medical interventions that could make memories more or less sticky. By stimulating or suppressing the parts of the brain network that function as the “bridges,” there’s an opportunity to increase or decrease the level of integration in the brain that strengthens memory. “We found that when participants are experiencing these highly emotional events, diverse brain regions tend to be more coordinated with one another, or are more integrated,” Park says. “If we can deliberately disrupt or enhance that integration, it may open the door to interventions that help weaken traumatic memories.” More practically, the study offers a new set of tools to probe memories in different ways. It marks a major step in allowing researchers to better measure what makes emotional memories sticky.",49f8c95cbaece522b92e95045dd02a0e980404ca93f06cf8158d5a4225b980cf

Among those hundreds of students will be the first two recipients of the new undergraduate data science degree, Noor Elmasry and Alex Hayward. When the major launched last fall , Elmasry and Hayward immediately signed up, participating in the Data Science Clinic and taking courses on ethics, fairness, responsibility, and privacy in data science, machine learning, and data visualization. Both students immediately parlayed their degree and experience into prestigious positions at Google and Prudential. We talked to Noor and Alex before their graduation in early June. Tell us what attracted you to data science and why you chose the major. Noor Elmasry : I came in as a philosophy and physics double major. I really wanted to answer the big questions in life, and I felt like those two were particularly compatible. But then my interest grew into data science when I realized that a lot of the work I’d be doing with physics after graduation wouldn’t address those larger questions. I wanted to make a more immediate impact, and that led me to consider something like data science. I realized it still has all the elements of scientific process and methodology. But the way that you define the questions makes it easier to come up with an answer or a resolution and address things on a higher turnaround. I guess just being an impatient person, I wanted to make an immediate impact, but obviously not at the expense of a rigorous scientific method.",61d0acac3fe3ad647e6d6b77910afd80dfaba238ec86c577b25f1a5093c1b6c3

I still feel like philosophy and data science are incredibly compatible, and also quite similar. You have premises, definitions, and well-defined questions that you can assess whether or not you can answer given your tools. Alex Hayward : Previously, I was a molecular engineering major, and I was fortunate enough to engage in a couple of research projects at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and UChicago Medicine. Throughout these experiences, I grew a hunger for creating some kind of social impact. I think there are a lot of opportunities for that in molecular engineering, but my exposure to research really showed me the opportunities for impact throughout the data science lifecycle. We were defining a problem, figuring out how to collect or acquire data, really getting into the weeds of the data to figure out whether it’s the right type of data to answer our question or solve our problem, then running analyses and translating results to different kinds of audiences. So I grew really excited about data science across the different research projects I was on and thought that gaining more foundational, theoretical background through the data science minor would strengthen my skills in the research environment. I used to joke with my friends that if there was a data science major, then I would switch to it immediately. I think it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made during my undergraduate career.",6eb8a211ecbd4a9e910d9126bc13c944c50e526724744c5e10bba8159506d2b8

I think that the introduction to data science sequence definitely follows that path, in that it gives you the tools to learn how to break down a problem into different steps of the data science lifecycle. First, we ask if data science is the right type of approach to answer our question, defining our problem. Then we really dive step-by-step through the process of how to produce a data science result. I still sometimes look at the slides from those courses, because the other classes in the major draw so much from those introductory principles. I think that’s what will make the data science major really strong: learning how to decompose your question or problem from the very beginning and getting more advanced experiential work later on. Noor Elmasry : One thing that I think was really influential is how they differentiated thinking like a data scientist versus thinking like a statistician or computer scientist. The intro course is really important to set up how you enter problems differently as a data scientist, and what framework of thinking applies to you more than someone else who might be focused on the user experience or back end.",13bbf61c6b62a995499964f0f1fe03271052e68568e33e389ec41865277120fa

Emphasizing ethics from the start, whether you’re in the minor or major, has made this program really unique. We’re not only having discussions about privacy, responsibility, and other ethical principles within the data science industry, but we’re also learning how to implement quantitative methods that may reflect those principles in data science systems themselves. We got to explore what those values might look like by design and go beyond just a conversation about ethics in data science. Noor Elmasry : Realizing, wow, there are actually quantitative measures for fairness, and being able to draw those connections with my other major in philosophy was really important. I also really enjoyed mathematical foundations of machine learning, partly just because I really enjoyed the learning environment and the professor [Eric Jonas], but also because I felt like previously I was either just doing a lot of linear algebra or talking at a high level about bias and machine learning, but this class really connected the two for me. Alex Hayward : The faculty have been really engaging and excited about the data science that’s being done here at the university now.

Noor Elmasry : I worked with Hohonu on the water level prediction project. I really enjoyed the project. I think it speaks to the variety of different fields where data science can help supplement research or analysis. We were working with tides, and how to use specific algorithms that could take a time series that has cycles, not just within a day, but within a month or a year. Taking into consideration all of these parameters of the natural world into your algorithm was really exciting. Initially, we were cleaning their pipeline. So all the nodes across the east and west coast as well as around Hawaii that gather information about water level, we had to identify nodes that were failing. So defining those different thresholds, and different tests, and then producing visualizations to show the improvement from our cleaning process. In the second quarter, we focused on prediction algorithms and comparing that to the national standard. Hohonu already has a pretty impressive prediction rate, and it was our job to increase that accuracy. I also loved working with my team, I feel like I learned so much from them, because we all came from different backgrounds. And I really loved the workflow as well, being able to work on a real world problem, take code from other people and manage it.

Our project focused on what it means to use AI ethically, what kinds of ethical principles currently exist, and what ethical AI looks like in practice. Essentially, we were trying to build a tool or metric to evaluate the extent to which companies use data and AI ethically. Our main limitation was that we could only use publicly available data. So we explored news media, as well as SEC filings to gain a better picture of how different companies might be interested in or using AI. One thing that I really appreciated from the start of the project was that there was, again, a focus on foundational principles. The first thing we did was dive into a deep literature review of what it means to use AI ethically. We created an ethical AI framework around which we built different AI systems to investigate ethical data and AI use. It was a really formative experience to be thrown into what data science looks like in industry. When I was applying for different projects in the course, I was really curious about how the data science lifecycle looks from the industry side of things. We were lucky to be able to frequently meet with Prudential and gain their constant feedback.

I felt lucky to experience how Prudential thinks about data science and learn about the kinds of problems they’re interested in exploring with data science. I also gained fantastic mentors that taught me more than I could have hoped for. The fact that they were even interested in this question of ‘what does ethical AI mean?’ set them apart from other teams. To invest in working jointly with a research institution to explore these problems shows how passionate Prudential is about data and AI ethics.

It’s been an incredible experience to work with Prudential on the Clinic project, and I am so grateful to have the opportunity to continue with Prudential after graduation. Noor Elmasry : I will start this summer as an associate business data scientist at Google. I recognize that there still might be a small disconnect with how data science is being taught and how it’s being used in industry, just purely by virtue of the field being so new, and how fast the field is developing. So I really want to gain as many skills as I can, and continue learning. I think Google will be a really great place to do that. But I think the clinic projects specifically showed me how relevant and valuable data science can be to social impact. That’s ultimately what I want to go into, and that’s something I’m looking forward to, but also just surrounding myself with people who are thinking about data science in the meantime. As the first UChicago data science graduates, what advice do you have for students considering the major?

Alongside his mentor, Dr. Chard, Alex developed a machine learning model that can effectively simulate dehydration reactions in about two minutes. “I had no experience in either quantum chemistry or machine learning prior to my research,” said Alex. “Now, I am more interested in exploring the quantum field in college. This was my first research project, so I was not sure how it would go. I loved it, and it really solidified my plans to do CS in the future. I want to do something like this next summer.” These projects and many more can be viewed on the Summer Lab website .

After a two-week intensive training on data science techniques and research methodology, the undergraduate and master’s students were unleashed to work with partner social impact organizations, using their newly acquired data science skills to benefit nonprofits and influence policy. The Summer Experience students worked with partner social impact organizations such as RAFI-USA and the Chicago Public Library , researching in small groups and using their data science skills to benefit others and influence policy. Professors and preceptors from the University of Chicago assisted the students in their research, as did professors from the diverse group of Capacity Accelerator Network partner institutions: North Carolina State University, Morehouse College, Howard University, City Colleges of Chicago, Fresno State, the University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of Illinois Chicago. Each project highlighted the need for data science training as an accessible resource for communities facing complicated problems. The students were pleased with their results, as were their preceptors and facilitators. “During the summer, students applied a variety of data science techniques to address important issues in their communities.",ef16d6824d18896ab178fd1815cc2a81438c5ec1878e1ec56d00223a6653814e

The student’s projects and their impacts are summarized below. Students Isaiah Gonzalez, Shana McDowell, Folasade Fanegan, and Grace Simunek studied the use of pesticides alongside Californians for Pesticide Reform . Using tools from spatial data science and modeling, they investigated years of pesticide and census data, finding that areas with a larger Latino population tended to have more pesticide use, which can lead to higher rates of cancer and acute illness. Simunek shared that she was surprised and disturbed when she learned that pesticides cause cancer and can drift from the areas where they’re applied. She added that, while the government of California regulates pesticide application, pesticide drift is not regulated. Gonzalez added that, as a student from Fresno, this research hits close to home. He described the odor emitted from the fields across the street from his home when they’re sprayed with pesticides. For Gonzalez, this research highlighted the severity of the pesticide problem in California. In partnership with the Illinois Commission on Equity and Inclusion , Eke Agbai, Kennedy Coleman, Joseph Jaiyeola, and Santiago Segura assessed equity around state use of vendors from diverse communities.",bd09b76f069f50330b2732d322c046ae342f55362313b29aab0e4c6ea2e25413

The group mapped the locations of businesses that worked with the state of Illinois; investigated how the number of bids, number of contracts, and contract values varied by area; and looked at how those variables correlated with demographic data. They found that areas where more residents have bachelor’s degrees tend to have more bids and that vendors are clustered around densely populated areas. The tools they built, including models and an interactive map, can be updated as new data are collected. In the future, their research might help the state use their contract funding more strategically. Rajiv Shah, Danielle Hahn, Tasnim Alqudah, and Abby Reynolds worked with the Chicago Public Library (CPL) for their project. They researched how library use varies spatially and temporally, and investigated the relationship between library use and demographic data. The group found that neighborhoods with higher income and employment rates tend to have higher circulation and lower computer use, while neighborhoods with lower income and employment have higher computer use but less circulation. They also found that there are no large differences in average walking time to a library between racial groups. Young people and high school graduates tend to be located in areas closer to libraries, so the researchers suggested that CPL should consider areas with older residents and lower high school graduation rates when deciding where to build new libraries.",965cd5d93a278806a6aecdb10041ff08ef0a5609419685737918a8eca864766c

Ronald Carter Jr., Lizet Casas, Kristen Haddadin, and Moturi Ondeyo used Internet Equity Initiative (IEI) data to study disruptions in Internet service. After a recent major federal investment in broadband access, data that can show us where to prioritize funding is more important than ever. The IEI, one of the Data Science Institute’s research initiatives, placed devices in homes around Chicago and beyond to monitor internet speed and disruption. The Summer Experience Researchers used these data to build an interactive dashboard through which users can investigate differences in Internet disruption across space and time. Using their dashboard, the team found that the South Side of Chicago had the most Internet disruptions in 2022, and Chicago had more anomalies than other cities. Now that the team has learned more about where and when Internet disruptions occur, they suggested further research into the root causes of these anomalies. Alongside Preventing Blindness , a national nonprofit based in Chicago, students Adrian Gutierrez, Alex Herrejon, Myles Ndiritu, and Vira Kasprova studied where eye care providers are located and how access varies by region. They contextualized their research by sharing that more than 7 million Americans have permanent vision problems, and more than half of these cases were preventable.

They concluded that vulnerable populations live fairly close to eye care facilities and most people live in a census tract with some access to vision providers. There doesn’t seem to be a geographic access issue, so they suggested that future research could look at other potential barriers preventing access to eye care. Kenthia Roberts, David Sampedro, Sebastian Plaza, and Amir Harris worked with RAFI-USA to study the potential impacts of the Kroger/Albertsons grocery store merger. In 2021, nearly 70% of the grocery market was controlled by four brands. Albertsons and Kroger are two of those companies, and their proposed merger would further consolidate and concentrate the market. Focusing on data from 2022, the research team quantified how the merger would increase the newly consolidated company’s market share, decrease consumer choice, and cause the loss of approximately 50,000 jobs. Their study suggests that the merger would help Kroger/Albertsons compete with Costco and Walmart, a potential upside, but would be a bad deal for consumers and farmers. It would especially affect those in rural and micropolitan regions, who are more susceptible to unfair pricing. The researchers concluded that responsible oversight is essential. The relationships that the Data Science Institute has developed with partner institutions and social impact organizations paid off for the CAN Social Impact Summer Experience cohort.",5976062ed42f18192e3a1dffba32533c167e79f239d6fd7fd48a4132f9843b78

This year…the “in-person” part didn’t seem so wise. But despite its remote format, the 2020 Summer Lab will be the biggest edition yet, with 37 students from around the world working as research assistants with 29 faculty or staff mentors, studying applied machine learning and AI, human-computer interaction, computational social science, systems, and much more. Over the next ten weeks, Summer Lab students will contribute to innovative research that bridges data science and computational approaches with applications in physics, archeology, public policy, and many other fields. And they’ll do it from their homes around the United States, Europe, and Asia, meeting virtually with their mentors and peers through a variety of channels and events. “What the program really offers is exposure to cutting-edge, interdisciplinary data and computational science — the entire lifecycle of data science,” said Kyle Chard , Summer Lab program director and research assistant professor with the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science. “Often, this is the first chance these students have to conduct research, and we focus on making sure that they see the opportunities and the excitement of science.” This week, the first half of the student cohort kicked off their summer with an online orientation, the first of many remote events that will preserve the i",146c1e1dba760fa861707135a68dac46fe3baa420d37d30f1f06b529b9e767a1

Students will engage in workshops, weekly panels and talks, and even trivia nights and scavenger hunts. “The real success that we enjoyed last year was seeing students really come into their own through research and participating in the cohort,” said Katherine Rosengarten, CDAC administrative specialist and co-organizer of Summer Lab. “The cohort isn’t something that you can make happen; you can only help build and foster it, and we do that through a balance of exciting, rigorous research work and community-based fun.” For the first time, the students will also participate in an “on-ramp” technical workshop, presented in partnership with The Carpentries , and communicate via a program Slack channel, sharing knowledge and experiences across multiple time zones. “We’ve learned in the past that the students learn as much from their peers as they do from their mentors, so I think that’s a particularly strong part of this program,” Chard said. This year’s class of 37 builds upon last year’s cohort of 28 students in the inaugural year of the CDAC Summer Lab (the program succeeded the Computation Institute summer research program, started in 2012). Like last year, the group is over half women and minorities underrepresented in computer science — which the team credited to expanded efforts to reach a broad range of students and schools and encourage all to apply, regardless of prior research experience. The outreach was a success, generating more than 300 applications, three times higher than 2019.",7065eaf8e8e97be94927c34473a899a31a1865998505844f780203b48d664724

So we’re very excited about that.” The Data & Democracy initiative — a partnership between the DSI and the Center for Effective Government at the Harris School of Public Policy — combines University expertise from computer science, political science, law, and neuroscience to understand politics and government in the digital age. “This is a big space, where we need help from people who have been thinking long and hard about this digital environment, how to measure it, how to characterize it,” said William Howell , Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics at the University of Chicago. “This is what this university does so well, right? I mean, this is about bridging those divisions across disciplines in a serious way.” Defining the field of data science means creating a new pipeline for students to become data scientists, starting from an early age and with inclusive practices that make the discipline accessible to people of all backgrounds.

If we do that, we’ll be pretty successful.” At UChicago, the new undergraduate major in data science was designed with that goal in mind. The degree offers several options for students, including tracks dedicated to theory, computation, or a balance of the two, and like the data science minor before it, can be combined with another speciality into a complementary double major. “I think the data science major and minor is the most important thing that I’ve seen here in 25 years for the undergrads,” said Steve Levitt , William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor in Economics and the College. “It’s teaching them a set of skills that are incredibly practical and useful in life and in business. But it’s deeper than that.

However, diversity in these fields has lagged behind overall trends. According to a Pew Research Center analysis, in 2018 Latinx students earned 12% of the bachelor’s degrees awarded in the United States in STEM fields, and Black students earned just 7%. In 2019, Black students made up just 6.8% of all enrollees in master’s degree programs, 3.7% of all doctoral programs, and just 1.6% of postdoctoral researchers in science, engineering, and health fields. The UChicago-CCC partnership will identify, create, and accelerate new joint initiatives focused on research and education opportunities for students and faculty in the sciences, as well as build new pathways for CCC students to attend UChicago and other outstanding research-oriented institutions. “This relationship is about harnessing two of our city’s higher education assets to create unprecedented opportunities and, ultimately, a more inclusive economy,” said City Colleges of Chicago Chancellor Juan Salgado .",41d5f7146ba0ee9b7c2960aad50ee0d2a74dae8bbe2aed13c65a51551e830f00

CNNs are the first widespread example of a symmetry, in this case the translational symmetry of images, being used to advise much more efficient and transparent network architectures. More recently, CNNs were generalized to other non-commutative symmetry groups such as SO(3). However, in physics application one is more likely to encounter input data that belong to linear representations of Lie Groups, as opposed to being functions (or “images”) on a symmetric space of the group. To deal with such problems, I will present a general feed-forward architecture that takes vectors as inputs, works entirely in the Fourier space of the symmetry group, and is fully covariant. This approach allows one to achieve equal performance with drastically fewer learnable parameters, Moreover, the models become much more physically meaningful and more likely to be interpretable. My application of choice is in particle physics, where the main symmetry is the 6-dimensional Lorentz group.",3946b6565a9f409dfa0bef90eb09cce5c3d0291f086c9770ccbd99e32fccef5f

As part of this mission, the Initiative hosts the Schmidt AI in Science Speaker Series , which brings researchers at the vanguard of such scientific discovery to UChicago’s campus. Across disciplines, from robotics and climate science to materials discovery and computational biology, this year’s speakers explored fundamental questions about AI’s possibilities in research while demonstrating practical applications already affecting people today. The series featured 23 experts accelerating materials and drug discovery through AI, including some here on campus: Chibueze Amanchukwu (Neubauer Family Asst. Professor; Faculty Co-Director of AI+Science) shared his work using machine learning (ML) to accelerate decarbonization. Although many possible battery chemistries exist, he explained, most can’t be used beyond the lab because we lack electrolyte solvents to deploy them affordably, efficiently, and safely. While hundreds of thousands of molecules exist that could potentially work, previous research has explored fewer than 1000 of them. Amanchukwu’s team is using ML to predict electrolyte conductivity, stability, and efficiency, exploding the potential for compound discovery from an average of three new compounds discovered per year to seven.",3ea2c52566fc3e5392a8ea6c5bb6fc5a429ca69d466925e03e75690370b21fd2

In the spirit of the AI+Science Research Initiative , the event invited students to apply the latest in machine learning to advance methods for scientific discovery. Overall, the Hackathon drew engagement from across the Sciences, with 34 students from the Computer Science, Chemistry, and Astrophysics Departments presenting at the final event. Said Ludwig Schneider , a Schmidt AI in Science Fellow and a veteran judge and organizer of the event, “The Hackathon brings together perspectives from different fields and demonstrates potential ways AI can enhance discovery.” Eight student teams took on one of two projects, either using AI to characterize new research materials, or using reinforcement learning for biological neuronal networks. Teams were provided with an initial training on the subject, a mentor from among the Schmidt AI in Science Fellows, and access to NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train their models. Following a two-week sprint, teams reconvened to make their cases before a panel of judges. Using AI to Forge Ahead in Scientific Discovery The first of the two projects sought to influence neuronal networks in real time through reinforcement learning (RL). Historically, researchers have used fixed stimulation patterns to study the learning and memory properties of biological neuronal networks (BNNs)—tiny, lab-grown networks of living neurons from the brain.",1998c5e77812a446e8fd8ca06414de4b1a6b190d2d860c1c0624058d437eceaf

To this end, students were tasked with developing RL agents capable of electrically stimulating neuronal cultures to train them in real time. Students shared the approaches they undertook to balance exploitation of existing knowledge with exploration of new possibilities. Graduate students Qianyi He (MSDS ’26) and Zhuyiheng Chu (MCAM ’26) explored a few possibilities before settling on a novel strategy involving transformers, which ultimately won with the highest observed performance of the day. Stephan Ihle , a Schmidt AI in Science Fellow as well as an organizer and judge of the event, conducts research in the space and pitched the project for the Hackathon after seeing its resonance with students in the past. “Not only does the Hackathon offer students from diverse backgrounds a fun opportunity to try something new,” he said, “but it also helps us see how they’re thinking: different students look at things in different ways, and that’s exactly what we saw today.” Pointing to the winning approach, he added, “Using transformers in hindsight feels obvious, but I would never have thought of this myself.” The second project challenged students to identify new research materials using AI. Across the sciences, X-rays are frequently used to characterize new research materials.",de24be4d61444f8915a96d5ed6ed1c97c994b482a4754992e5f2cdc104d9d085

Graph-neural networks (GNNs) offer the potential to accomplish this faster and at lower costs. The project was proposed by Schmidt AI in Science Fellow and Hackathon organizer Adam Fouda , whose research is closely-related. Challenged to develop GNN models to predict CEBE from molecular structure, student teams drew on their respective training to formulate their approaches. The winning group included Bhavnesh Jangid, Valay Agarawal, and Jacob Wardzala, PhD candidates in the Chemistry Department and Joshua Zhou, a PhD candidate in the Molecular Engineering Department. “We had a great time during the hackathon,” said Joshua. “It’s not often you get to learn something new in the context of a well-defined problem, and the DSI and the AI+Science Research Initiative provided all the support and guidance we needed.” Encouraging Students to Experiment in the Sciences Schneider, who completes his fellowship this spring, was inspired to organize the event for a second year in a row because, having participated in hackathons in the past, he finds them uniquely re-energizing: “In research, sometimes you’re so focused on one topic that you can miss the low-hanging fruit next to it. The hackathon forces you out of that bubble.” He added, “It feels really good to learn something quickly.",5ca7e1817aacb066d4188e762a0173ca3cd94d77fd703ffc5b4363b45d0ede39

In this case, the 2025 Hackathon was a success. Zhuyiheng Chu (MCAM ’26), a member of the winning RL team, said, “Designing a model to solve a real-world problem was both challenging and exciting—it pushed us to think creatively and rigorously under time constraints. Qianyi He (MSDS ’26), also from the winning RL team, said, “It was a great opportunity to explore real-time interaction between AI and living neurons with support from the DSI and the AI+Science Research Initiative. By restructuring raw spiking data into a compact and meaningful state, our RL agent adapted more efficiently — highlighting that thoughtful data representation can outweigh model complexity.” Thank you to all participants for their engagement, and congratulations to the winning teams.

A prime example of this advancement is the development of simulation tools for molecular systems, sometimes referred to as “the computational microscope.” These tools allow us to delve into the atomic details of biological molecules and their interactions in ways that traditional experimental techniques cannot. In all biological systems, including humans, biomolecules engage in complex interactions that are crucial for sustaining life, yet understanding these interactions poses significant challenges. Simulation tools enable researchers to gain more insights into these systems. Based on these insights, we can design more effective drugs, elucidate disease mechanisms at a molecular level, and engineer biomaterials with tailored properties. Typically, simulating a biomolecular system involves modeling the interactions between thousands of atoms over more than 1012 steps, a task that remains computationally demanding even for modern high-performance computers with hundreds of CPUs. One strategy to mitigate this challenge is to develop less detailed but still accurate models known as coarse-grained models . These models have been successfully used to study large biomolecule complexes, such as the HIV capsid (a protein shell that encases the virus’s genetic material). This research offers new insights into the virus and aiding therapeutic development.",b0bea556cc8bbaf40f0165c4199e4c8186c7d442e5d310748726ffa375d0ada8

This task is almost akin to a mission impossible because the dynamics of a system are usually highly sensitive to the interactions between its components. Just as the quality and impact of a musical performance depend not only on the precise tuning of each instrument but also on the interplay of numerous factors—such as the skill and emotion of the musicians, the type of instruments used, and even the response of the audience—so too does the simulation of biological systems depend on multiple finely adjusted interactions. Without a clear understanding of how the interactions between components contribute to its outcomes, which is unfortunately true for both musical performance and biomolecular modeling, it becomes extremely difficult to predict and control system behavior effectively. Nonetheless, accurately modeling the dynamics of biomolecules is crucial, as many studies have revealed the profound connection between the kinetic of the biomolecules, i.e., how fast changes between different states, and their functional roles. The development of machine learning methods are one step towards solving this problem. In particular, the solution comes from the ideas behind generative AIs, which are capable of generating images almost indistinguishable from real ones. But what is the connection between such seemingly unrelated tasks? This link lies in the concept of probability.",12196742cfb777253627b97a833777da320a5ab2bdb37fd362c6505cb711ce5f

For instance, by training on diverse dog images, generative AI can discern typical canine features like shapes and colors. Similarly, when applied to coarse-grained modeling in physics, these AI techniques can learn to mimic the essential dynamics and interactions of a system by recognizing and reproducing the governing statistical distributions. This capability enables us to create highly accurate, simplified models of complex systems, providing a powerful tool for exploring phenomena that might otherwise be computationally prohibitive to study in detail. Adversarial training is one of the widely used strategies in training generative AI models. Adversarial training involves a dynamic interaction between two models. One model, known as the generator, attempts to create data so convincingly real that it could be mistaken for genuine data. The other model called the discriminator, evaluates whether the data produced by the generator is authentic or fabricated. Imagine the generator as a student trying to solve complex problems, while the discriminator acts like a teacher assessing the student’s solutions. The student (generator) strives to refine their answers based on the teacher’s (discriminator’s) feedback, aiming to develop solutions so accurately that they perfectly mimic a correct answer.",ef1c86493be3e285fdcee2cf2d978d24cb25d0ff9e6e7b9e3d6aa41cd46ce8a8

This interaction process helps both models improve over time — the generator becomes better at producing realistic data, and the discriminator becomes better at identifying fakes. The result is an AI system that can understand and replicate complex patterns in data much more effectively. Building on the idea of adversarial training, let’s explore how we can apply this technique to construct a coarse-grained model that effectively simulates the dynamics of a target system. Different from a typical scenario in which interplay occurs between two neural network models, in our framework, the “student” neural model is replaced by the coarse-grained (CG) model, and it is optimized according to the feedback of a “teacher” neural network model. Here’s how it works: The CG model, acting as the generator, attempts to generate trajectories that capture the essential dynamics of the original system. On the other side, we have a neural network that serves as the discriminator. This neural network has been trained to understand the detailed dynamics of the system, which it uses as a benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the CG model. The discriminator assesses whether the outputs of the CG model closely match the real system’s dynamics. Whenever the CG model generates a new set of dynamics, the discriminator checks these against its knowledge of the true dynamics.",c11c4741363b5bc315ad0f88fd051155bc5f97fa1f531bf4ec12c34bfee318f9

This iterative process is akin to a continuous loop of hypothesis and verification, where the CG model proposes a set of dynamics and the neural network validates them. Through this adversarial process, the CG model is constantly learning and adjusting. It refines its parameters to better mimic the real system’s behavior, enhancing its ability to predict new situations with greater accuracy. This methodology that we are developing offers a new perspective on modeling the dynamics of biomolecular systems, showing instead of their direct application in scientific discovery, the AI models synergize with existing methods to embrace the application in challenging situations. With the support of AI and powerful computational resources, we are moving steadily toward precise and efficient digital simulations of living systems.

And thus we have our first word — “orientation” — to describe a class of visually sensitive neurons. We can also say that “orientation tuning” is a “word model” of what this neuron does. Since then, neuroscientists have marched faithfully along the hierarchy of visually sensitive areas in the brain to find new kinds of neurons that are activated by different features displayed on the screen. For instance, you can imagine a neuron connected to two orientation tuned neurons to become an “angle” or “corner” neuron. You can put many of them together to form a “curvature” neuron. Instead of edges, you can have neurons sensitive to different “colors” and “textures.” Put all these together to form “object” or “face” or “tool” or “landscape” neurons. You can discover anatomical connections between the hierarchy of visual areas in the brain and come up with theories about how these neurons develop their sensitivities and what would happen if the inputs from the eyes were degraded somehow. If you tell a neuroscientist that a neuron in a specific part of the brain is orientation tuned, they can guess its provenance, development, anatomical connections with its inputs and outputs, the properties of the neurons in its neighborhood, and what would happen if you removed it from the circuit.",9910d5e7f2be9b823c97561aebb080450ad416ace895156db6b2813c0a44104a

But there has always been a sword of Damocles hanging above our models of vision. Remember the “orientation” tuned neuron? That one was a bit of an exception, turns out*. As soon as you put two of these simple neurons together, the number of types of responses explode. Indeed, even Hubel and Wiesel thought it “unwise” to label neurons “curvature” or “corner” detectors because those monikers “neglect the importance of” the other properties of objects. They simply labeled them “simple”, “complex” or “hypercomplex” cells and described their responses in great detail while admitting that they were describing a subset of all types and that their descriptions were very likely impoverished. Because of this, none of our models were able to generate good predictions about how neurons would respond to photographs of natural scenes which have an intractably rich variety of visual features. Nevertheless, for fifty years, we have been using all these categorical words to describe the neurons that mediate our perception of the visual world, knowing full well that the categories are imperfect and their boundaries permeable. *In fact, even those neurons aren’t exceptions and orientation tuning as a model is probably just as impoverished a model as any other. About a decade ago, visual neuroscientific inquiry was introduced to a new kind of vocabulary, a new kind of model of a neuron.",529c5661da55879dd91590cb155da67e9c3492ac42cfc6383391dcaa22b7d379

Let’s unpack that. A machine learning model was trained to bin images into categories like “German Shepard dog” or “table lamp” or “pizza.” It just so happens that the units of computation in that model (individual filters or combinations of filters) respond in similar ways to input images as the units of computation in our brains (individual neurons or combinations of neurons). Scientists could also invert this argument and test the validity of the model by generating images for which the models have specific predictions for neural activity. In other words, they could use the model to create an image that could activate a neuron in the brain more than any other image. So all you need to describe a visual neuron is this image generated by the best model of that neuron — the more like this image a random photograph was, the more the neuron would respond. Now, instead of saying a neuron was “orientation tuned,” you could provide either the deep network model that predicts its activity or an image that maximally drives the neuron. These findings have moved the needle significantly for many visual neuroscientists. For some, these models are hypothesis generation machines — a good model can predict the responses of neurons in a variety of untested conditions like testing a deep network face neuron model on objects.",da5b0a1162ed3857aff06205c56332bc316183e9da7aedd33f2bb16efa9b374f

And for still others, a deep network model of a neuron is a total replacement of the word models that came before it. For most, in the belabored metaphor introduced at the top of this article, these models and images have added a fundamentally new kind of vocabulary to how we describe visual neurons. This raises deep questions about the goal of the visual neuroscientific enterprise. Are models of neurons that predict their responses to a very large, diverse set of images sufficient to understand visual perception? More fundamentally, what does it mean to “understand” vision? At the limit, if I could create a model that could precisely predict the responses of a visual neuron to every image, have we “understood” vision? Can we declare victory if we have a card catalog of images that maximally drive every single visual neuron in the brain? Maybe a hint of an answer comes from Hubel and Wiesel themselves — “… it should perhaps be stressed that a proper understanding of the part played by any cell in a sensory system must depend not simply upon a description of the cell’s responses to sensory stimuli, but also on a knowledge of how the information it conveys is made use of at higher levels… How far such analysis can be carried is anyone’s guess, but it is clear that these transformations … go only a short way toward accounting for the perception of shapes encountered in everyday life.” Also, in the words of pe",844e979daf1cffc3760e2d28529471738728dd722da1355d36a5ff3e53d5d284

I am interested in how dimensions of visual information are extracted by the brain and then used to make decisions. In a recent study , we showed that the reason we can extract information about foreground objects while the background changes dramatically is that the visual information about the foreground and the background is represented orthogonally in the brain. In an upcoming manuscript, we demonstrate that visual neurons guide the extraction of information and the behavior based on that information by flexibly modifying their responses based on cognitive demands. We also discovered a possible mechanism by which these visual neurons could be doing that using simulations and AI methods. Stay tuned for an article about those results!

One noticeable feature of biological materials is their adaptability , the ability of a material to switch between mutually incompatible functions with minimal changes. Consider the skin of a chameleon; with just a few changes to the structure of pigments in its cells, a chameleon’s skin is capable of becoming a totally different color. What sort of processes could create materials which could also rapidly switch function, like a chameleon’s skin? It turns out that the two key ingredients for producing adaptability in biology are fluctuating environments and having many designs which achieve the same function. By continually forcing organisms to adapt to different stresses, evolution in fluctuating environments selects for the rare design solutions which can be rapidly switched, should the environment fluctuate again. My collaborators and I have been thinking about how this intuition can be adapted not just for biological systems which evolve, but also for materials which we design. We designed an elastic network to exhibit an out-of-phase allosteric motion – that is, if you pinch the network on the bottom, it will spread apart on the top. We also made networks that have in-phase allosteric motion – pinching these networks on the bottom will result in the network also pinching in on the top. For both of these motions, there are many different network designs which will achieve the desired motion.",5c9284c2cdbcf6de53c942d7e63eedcd1ea9fc5b249bebf589a1d6a789c30724

Such networks are not adaptable; it would take many changes to the network structure in order to switch from one network to the other. Excitingly, we found that if you alternate back and forth between designing first for the out-of-phase motion and then for the in-phase motion, the elastic network solutions you find will look very similar to each other! Therefore, despite the fact that the out-of-phase motion and the in-phase motion are totally opposite types of motions, we found materials which can rapidly adapt between them. Furthermore, just as our intuition from biology suggests, these adaptable networks are much rarer, and hence we needed the alternating design process to find them. We also tested our alternating design process in two other kinds of material systems: elastic networks created to have different bulk material properties, as opposed to motions, as well as polymers created to fold into different structures, like proteins. In each case, we found that alternating design goals resulted in adaptable materials. In the case of the polymers folding into different structures, we were also able to identify a physical principle underlying the existence of these adaptable materials – the physics of phase transitions , the same physics underlying the tempering of chocolate . Therefore, our method not only worked, but also helped us to better understand how materials can be made to adapt.",7af1736be4d28ed4ec97a597f5b3603f9008f4e5d20115688e2447ecd43e7283

Interestingly though, this x-ray damage process is not all bad. In some cases, detecting it can itself be a powerful characterization tool; and furthermore, the effect is now being explored in novel cancer therapies that selectively target tumor cells. The physics underlying damage effect is described by quantum mechanics (the theory describing the behavior of atoms and electrons), this limits its effective simulation in complex real-world systems. However, the opportunity for AI accelerated predictions of more complex systems has emerged through the development of accurate quantum mechanical method s for generating small molecule datasets and the availability of benchmark experiments. X-rays can characterize the arrangement of atoms forming the shape of complex materials, such as proteins or nanoparticle catalysts through x-ray scattering techniques.

Researchers utilize the powerful characterization properties of the bright x-rays on subjects ranging from combustion engines, batteries, protein structures, cancer treatments and advanced research materials. X-ray damage effects happen when x-ray absorption interferes with x-ray scattering measurements. For example, in proteins that contain metal atoms, the absorption of metal atoms by the x-rays dominates the interaction during the scattering measurement. Consequently, almost all such protein structures reported in the protein databank are compromised . This happens because the x-ray absorption removes the electrons most tightly bound to the atoms nucleus. This creates an unstable state that collapses by a complicated decay process which ejects multiple electrons from the atom. The removal of negatively charged electrons leaves a positively charged environment about the metal atom which changes the protein structure during the x-ray scattering characterization. However, this x-ray damage process can in-fact be utilized.",bb53f40a59ac5d18a24f4f6c0b026f8110d5ab9b2d2ce45feafec49faac5b51a

This is because the ejected electrons are not tightly bound to the nucleus and are more involved with the bonding to the neighboring atoms. Another useful property of the ejected electrons is that they can have relatively low energies compared to fluorescence decay and the nuclear decay of radioactive atoms. The low energy ejected electrons have short travel distances in aqueous environments because they are likely to ionize nearby water molecules. This makes them effective at characterizing the structure of a materials surface in an aqueous solution. This has successfully been applied to characterizing the differences in water molecule arrangements at the material surface and bulk solution in a battery cell system . The short travel distances in aqueous environments has applications beyond materials characterization. Novel radionucleotide cancer therapies also exploit this effect. Once a radionucleotide atom in a molecule undergoes a nuclear decay process, a tightly bound electron is also lost from it. This mimics x-ray absorption and initiates the same decay cascade process. Near a tumor cell, the low energy electrons ejected from the radionucleotide and neighboring atoms can effectively damage the tumor whilst causing minimal damage to the surrounding tissue.",c9304efca35c267ee348c5cf2f5bc0902fb65898337afd15384d55e2adf60ec4

Despite all these advantages, it’s hard to simulate the decay process as it relies on quantum mechanics. Furthermore, the number of possible decay channels scales exponentially with the size of the system and simulations are thus restricted to atoms, small molecules, and simplistic aqueous environments. However, reliable AI predictions of larger systems are now possible through recent developments in accurate and efficient methods for small (5-10 atoms) organic molecules, and the availability of benchmark experimental data on these systems and more complex ones. We are developing a deep neural network that inputs information of the atomic placements about the absorbing atom site and outputs the decay signal. The input only requires the knowledge of the molecular geometry, and the trained model will therefore bypass the need for further quantum mechanics calculations. Because the decay of each individual absorbing atom is mostly affected by its adjacent atoms, we believe our trained model will accurately predict the decay of organic molecules too large for a quantum mechanics simulation. Our model will be trained across thousands of different atomic environments across a set of mid-size organic molecules. Therefore, the model should be able to combine any number of different local atomic environments together to generate the decay signals of much larger systems.",a881c905347f10748c9f4e5c0e70ea46102c4064994b6edeea8891ab4b1ecf2b

Following the discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), there have been 10 years of searches for new physics without discovery. The LHC, shown below, collides protons at nearly the speed of light to convert large quantities of energy to exotic forms of matter via the energy-mass relationship E=mc2. The goal of our searches is to discover new particles which could answer some of the universe’s most fundamental questions. What role does the Higgs play in the origin and evolution of the Universe? What is the nature of dark matter? Why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe? Given the absence of new particles, the field is devising new methods, technologies, and theories. Some of the most exciting work is towards building more powerful colliders. In this work, an emerging theme is the use of machine learning (ML) to guide detector and accelerator designs. The goal of building new colliders is to precisely measure known parameters and attempt to directly produce new particles. As of 2024, the most promising designs for future colliders are the Future Circular Collider (FCC), Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), International Linear Collider (ILC), and Muon Collider (MuC). The main difference between the proposals is the type of colliding particles (electrons/positrons, muons/anti-muons, protons-protons), the shape (circular/linear), the collision energy (hundreds vs. thousands of gigaelectronvolts), and the collider size (10 – 100 km).",d09dc7043b4f4e9f3ce368e8f22d99d7618174bc419ac36076b25874b1825875

Designing the accelerator and detector complexes for future colliders is a challenging task. The design involves detailed simulations of theoretical models and particle interactions with matter. Often, these simulations are computationally expensive, which constrains the possible design space. There is ongoing work to overcome this computational challenge by applying advances in surrogate modeling and Bayesian optimization. Surrogate modeling is the technique for creating a fast approximate simulation of an expensive, slow simulation, increasingly using neural networks. Bayesian optimization is a technique to optimize black box functions without assuming any functional forms. The combination of these approaches can reduce computing expenses considerably. An example of ML guided optimization is ongoing for one of the outstanding challenges for a MuC. A MuC is an exciting future collider proposal that would be able to reach high energies in a significantly smaller circumference ring than other options. To create this machine, we must produce, accelerate, and collide muons before they decay. A muon is a particle similar to the electron but around 200 times heavier. The most promising avenue for this monumental challenge starts by hitting a powerful proton beam on a fixed target to produce pions, which then decay into muons. The resulting cloud of muons is roughly the size of a basketball and needs to be cooled into a 25µm size beam within a few microseconds.",86b5abfb4561c8f6203ba20c4dfb08a9e16b8be8f0ade2c1a8f944034e46fdf6

Previously proposed cooling methods did not meet physics needs and relied on ultra-powerful magnets beyond existing technology. There are alternative designs that could remedy the need for powerful magnets, but optimization of the designs is a significant hurdle to assessing their viability. In a growing partnership between Fermilab and UChicago, we are studying how to optimize a muon-cooling device with hundreds of intertwined parameters. Each optimization step will require evaluating time and resource intensive simulations, constraining design possibilities. So, we are attempting to build surrogates of the cooling simulations and apply Bayesian optimization on the full design landscape. There have been preliminary results by researchers in Europe that show this approach has potential, but more work is needed. To make progress on this problem, we are starting simple – trying to reproduce previous results from classical optimization methods. Led by UChicago undergraduates Daniel Fu and Ryan Michaud, we are performing bayesian optimization using gaussian processes . This does not include any neural networks but helps build our intuition for the optimization landscape and mechanics of the problem. The first step of this process is determining if the expensive simulation can be approximated by a gaussian process to produce a fast surrogate.

The molecular details of this puzzle remain unsolved. Humans, in particular, are multi-scale organisms. Various biological systems (i.e. the respiratory system, digestive system, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, etc.) comprise the human body. Within each of these systems, there are organs, which are made of tissues. Each tissue is then made of cells. Within cells, there are smaller pieces of machinery known as organelles. Cells and organelles are composed of a variety of proteins and lipids. In particular, proteins that are embedded in lipids (as opposed to floating within the cell) are known as membrane proteins. Although there are clear differences between organisms (i.e. bacteria, humans, and mice) at the cellular and atomic scales, the protein machinery looks very similar. Indeed, challenges in predicting protein structure led to the breakthrough of AlphaFold , enabling scientists to make predictions on protein structure given a primary sequence of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). Cells and organelles across different organisms sense stimuli such as touch, heat, and voltage with a specific type of protein called a membrane protein.

These remarkable proteins play a pivotal role in cellular function by detecting and responding to changes in the electrical potential across the cell membrane. Through their sophisticated structure and mechanisms, voltage sensing membrane proteins enable cells to perceive, process, and transmit electrical signals essential for vital physiological processes such as neuronal communication (i.e. passing action potentials), muscle contraction, and cardiac rhythm regulation. For instance, neurons have voltage-gated ion channels – channels that open and allow the flux of ions into the cell to produce electrical signals. Despite the complexity of voltage sensing proteins that are able to sense different voltages with high sensitivity, the biology of voltage sensors is highly modular. Proteins that respond to voltage typically have what is known as a “voltage sensing domain,” or VSD. The VSD is usually coupled to a larger module that is responsible for function. For instance, in a voltage-gated ion channel, the ion channel itself is coupled to one or more VSDs that enable it to behave in a voltage-sensitive way.

At its root, we would like to determine any patterns between voltage sensors that may have similar function, turning the problem into one of “pattern recognition” that can be tackled with machine learning. Analogous pattern recognition problems have been carried out by computer scientists for decades. The MNIST data set is a classic task in machine learning for classifying hand-written digits. The key concept in classifying MNIST digits is that each digit has a set of characteristics, or “features,” that underlies its membership to a certain label (in this case, 1 through 9). Humans can identify these digits, but a machine learning model must pick out the key similarities and differences between these digits to separate them. In a similar vein, VSDs must have underlying features and characteristics that make them uniquely sensitive to different voltages. One key difference that makes working with scientific data more challenging than MNIST is that we do not always have labels. Or more specifically, we do not know the sensitivity of the voltage sensor unless a functional study has been carried out. Using machine learning to fingerprint and cluster VSDs represents an opportunity to move beyond sequence-to-structure prediction, like AlphaFold, and on to structure-to-function analysis.",67aae410f9cba92b48ebabee7618aec15485c4cb154a646ee6e2e2f9594942ea

A starting hypothesis you would like to test could be: is an increase of a specific pollutant associated with a reduction (or increase) of white matter in newborns? A typical study to test this hypothesis would involve recruiting pregnant women, measuring the average amount of pollutants they are exposed to throughout their pregnancy, and measuring the newborn’s proportion of white matter, which is a measure of connectivity. After the collection, the data analysis would involve assessing if at least one of the car pollutants is correlated with the newborn’s brain measurements. It is now well established that exposure to car pollutants during pregnancy is associated with reduced white matter proportion in newborns. A natural follow-up question would be among all these car pollutants which is likely to cause a reduction in white matter? That is when things become more tricky. Because cars tend to produce the same amount of each pollutant (or at least the proportion of pollutants they emit is somewhat constant), we observe little variation in car pollutant proportion over time in a given city. It would be even worse if we only studied women from the same neighborhood and recruited them during a similar period of time (as we expect the car pollutants to be quite homogeneous within a small area).",d6aeca76f386ab32a225c89b5ea198f1cbd9c67a5f96f746d18fb5de33ba4373

Correlation has been a primary subject of interest since the early days of statistics. While correlation is often a quantity of inferential interest (e.g., predicting house price given its surface), in some cases, it can plague an analysis as it is hard to distinguish between potential causes that are correlated (as described above). Assume now that exactly two pollutants among four that are affecting newborn white matter. Pollutants 1 and 3, say — and that these two pollutants are each completely correlated with another non-effect pollutant, say pollutants 1 and 2 are perfectly correlated and pollutants 2 and 4. Here, because the pollutants are completely correlated with a non-effect pollutant, it is impossible to confidently select the correct pollutants that are causing health problems. However, it should be possible to conclude that there are (at least) two pollutants that affect white matter, for the first pollutant that affects white matter it is whether (pollutant 1 or pollutant 2), for the first pollutant that affects white matter it is whether (pollutant 3 or pollutant 4). This kind of statement (pollutant 3 or pollutant 4) is called credible sets in the statistical genetic literature.",52c53abc3d09b92c7d9245f142f56d614797425886e9e6307a06973a78809a25

A credible set is a subset of the variables that have at least 95% to contain at least one causal variable. In our example, the pollutants are the variables. Inferring credible sets is referred to as fine mapping. Until recently, most of the statistical approaches were working well for computing credible sets in the case that exactly one pollutant affects newborn white matter. Recent efforts led by the Stephens’ lab and other groups suggest enhancing previous models by simply iterating them through the data multiple times. For example, suppose I have made an initial guess for the credible sets for the first effect pollutant. Now, I can remove the effect of the pollutant from my data and guess the credible sets for the second effect. Once this is done, we can refine our guess for the first pollutant by removing the effect of the second credible set from the data and continuing to repeat this procedure until convergence. The example we presented above is quite simple as a maximum of a hundred pollutants and derivatives are being studied, and they can be potentially tested one by one in a lab using mice. The problem becomes much harder in genetics, where scientists try to understand the role of hundreds of thousands of variants on molecular regulation. And in fact, genetic variants tend to be much more correlated than car pollutants. And this complexity increases as we try to understand more complex traits.",8cc02bcbb1c87f37821f071fb7e9a9cf15e82ff285e07bd37444e21a6a2d2efa

Our current work is generalizing the iterative procedure described here to a more complex model. One of the main difficulties is to find a good trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency. More complex models capture more subtle variation in the data but are more costly to estimate. We use ideas from signal processing methods ( wavelet ) to perform fast iterative procedures to corner genetic variants (or car pollutants) that affect dynamic or spatially structured traits (e.g., white matter development throughout childhood or DNA methylation). We present some of the advantages of our new work in Figure 1. Coming back to our earlier example where pollutants 1 and 3 affect white matter. The main problem with fine-mapping pollutants that affect temporally-structured traits is that standard fine-mapping may suggest that pollutant 1 affects white matter proportion at birth but then may suggest that pollutant 2 affects white matter at three months. Thus leading to inconsistent results throughout childhood. Using a more advanced model that can look at each child’s trajectory (instead of at each time point separately as normally done) allows for more consistent and interpretable results. We illustrate this advantage in Figure 1.

Different wavelengths of light are detected in different ways and used for different purposes. Traditional telescopes collect and focus optical light (the same wavelengths seen by the eye) in order to view distant stars and galaxies. Large radio dishes capture the much lower frequency radio waves that comprise the Cosmic Microwave Background, a baby picture of the early Universe. And x-ray telescopes in orbit around the Earth catch bursts of high-energy light from all manner of explosions throughout the Universe. Whatever the wavelength, though, these are all differential realizations of the same physical phenomenon: ripples in the electromagnetic field, a.k.a. electromagnetic waves, a.k.a. light. Humanity’s astronomical toolkit categorically expanded in September 2015, with the first detection of a new kind of astronomical phenomenon: a gravitational wave . Gravitational waves are exactly what they sound like: a ripple in gravity. The new ability to detect and study these gravitational waves offers an entirely new means of studying the Universe around us, one that has allowed us to study never before seen objects in uncharted regions of the cosmos.

If you have spent any time watching the History Channel or reading popular science articles, you have probably encountered the idea of gravity as curvature. Today, physicists understand the nature of gravity via Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, which describes gravity not as an active force that grabs and pulls objects, but as the passive curvature or warping of space and time (together known as spacetime) by matter. The Earth, for example, is not kept in its orbit via a force exerted by the Sun. Instead, the Sun curves the surrounding fabric of spacetime, and the Earth’s motion along this curved surface inscribes a circle, just like a marble rolling on some curved tabletop. This arrangement is often summarized as follows: “Matter tells spacetime how to bend, spacetime tells matter how to move .” With this analogy in mind, now imagine doing something really catastrophic: crash two stars together; let the Sun explode; initiate the birth of a new Universe in a Big Bang. Intuition suggests that the fabric of spacetime would not go undisturbed by these events, but would bend and vibrate and twist in response. This intuition is correct. These kinds of events indeed generate waves in spacetime, and are what we call gravitational waves. Strictly speaking, almost any matter in motion can generate gravitational waves.",f344f2a841f07be9796e64538413b6e1ed05b35ebac69086f5545ef7c411ee5b

You generate gravitational waves any time you move. In practice, however, only the most violent and extreme events in the Universe produce gravitational waves that are remotely noticeable, and even these end up being extraordinarily weak. To explain what exactly I mean “extraordinarily weak,” I first have to tell you what gravitational waves do . I introduced gravitational waves via an analogy to light; the latter is a ripple in the electromagnetic field and the former a ripple in the gravitational field. This description, though hopefully intuitive, masks a fundamental peculiarity of gravitational waves. All other waves — light, sound waves, water waves, etc. — are phenomena that necessarily move inside of space and time (it would not make sense for anything to exist outside space and time!). Gravitational waves, though, are ripples of space and time. There is no static frame of reference with which to view gravitational waves; gravitational waves manifest as perturbations to the frame itself. What does this mean in practice? The physical effect of a gravitational wave is to modulate the distances between objects. Imagine two astronauts floating freely in space. A passing gravitational wave will stretch and shrink the distance between them. Critically, this occurs not because the astronauts move (they remain motionless), but because the space itself between them literally grows and shrinks (think of Doctor Who’s Tardis, wizarding world tents in Harry Potter, the House of Leaves’s House of Leaves).",f0a23d846dfffbfab232dfad3de51b93d94fe7f28ccdd0e77dd4064e7bec03b4

Gravitational waves are detected by a network of instruments across the globe, all of which use lasers to very precisely monitor the distances between mirrors separated by several kilometers. These mirrors are exquisitely isolated from the environment; to detect a gravitational wave, you must be utterly confident that the distances between your mirrors fluctuated due to a passing ripple in spacetime and not because of minuscule disturbances due to a car driving by, Earth’s seismic activity, ocean waves hitting the coast hundreds of miles away, etc. What kinds of events can we observe via gravitational waves, utilizing these detectors? Consider an object of mass M moving at speed v some distance D away. The gravitational wave strain you experience from this object is, to an order of magnitude, Here, I’ve used two additional symbols. The quantity is Newton’s gravitational constant and is the speed of light. Note that G is a very small number and c a very large number, so the ratio in the equation above is extremely small, working out to about !

Plugging these numbers in above, we find that you would experience a gravitational-wave strain of only h ∼ 10^−44. The important takeaway is that only the most massive and fastest-moving objects in the Universe will generate physically observable gravitational waves. One example of a massive and fast-moving system: a collision between two black holes . The Universe is filled with black holes, and sometimes pairs of these black holes succeed in finding each other and forming an orbiting binary. Over time, as these black holes emit gravitational waves, they lose energy and sink deeper and deeper in one another’s gravitational potential. As they sink closer together, the black holes move ever faster, in turn generating stronger gravitational-wave emission and hastening their progress in an accelerating feedback loop. Eventually, the black holes will slam together at very nearly the speed of light. This entire process is called a binary black hole merger. How strong are the final gravitational waves from these black hole mergers? Let’s plug some numbers into our equation above. Assume that the black holes are ten times the mass of our sun, M ∼ 2 × 10^31 kg, that they are moving at the speed of light, v ∼ c , and that they are a Gigaparsec (i.e. a few billion light years) away, D ∼ 3 × 10^25 m.

And yet the gravitational waves it generates are still astonishingly small. To successfully measure waves of this size, gravitational-wave detectors have to track changes of size Δ L ∼ 10^−19 m in the distances between their mirrors. This is a distance one billion times smaller than the size of an atom. It is equivalent to measuring the distance to the nearest star to less than the width of a human hair. And although this sounds like an impossible task (and indeed was believed to be so for almost a century), decades of technological and scientific advancements have made it a reality. In September 2015, the gravitational-wave signal from a merging binary black hole a billion light years away was detected by the Advanced LIGO experiment, initiating the field of observational gravitational-wave astronomy. We now live in a world in which gravitational-wave detection is a regular phenomenon. To date, about 150 gravitational-wave events have been witnessed. Most of these are from black hole collisions, and a handful involve the collisions of another class of object called a neutron star. How do we know the identities of these gravitational wave sources?

With over 60 unique proteins probed in situ, we can view the immune states in human tissue samples with astonishing detail. While powerful, these rich image data can be difficult to quantify, and therefore difficult to extract biological meaning from.

The precision with which we can extract this information is limited by the number of observed sources; the more systems we observe, the more we can learn about astrophysics and cosmology. However, as the precision of our measurements increases it becomes increasingly important to interrogate sources of bias intrinsic to our analysis methods. Given the number of sources we expect to observe in the coming years, we will need radically new analysis methods to avoid becoming dominated by sources of systematic bias. By combining physical knowledge of the observed systems and AI methods, we can overcome these challenges and face the oncoming tide of observations. In September 2015, a new field of astronomy was born with the observation of gravitational waves from the collision of two black holes over a billion light years away by the twin LIGO detectors. In the intervening years, the LIGO detectors have been joined by the Virgo detector and similar signals have been observed from over 100 additional merging binaries. Despite this large and growing number of observations, many more signals are not resolvable by current detectors due to observational selection bias. An example of this selection bias is that more massive binaries radiate more than less massive binaries and so are observable at greater distances.",2256e0f71045c2ae4fc86ed12a3e3502ff676502e8348e2cb25a9ac8bcb1c711

In addition, the planned next generation of detectors is expected to observe every binary black hole merger in the Universe, accumulating a new binary every few minutes. Each of these mergers is the end of an evolutionary path from pairs of stars initially more tens of times massive than the Sun. Over their lives, these stars passed through a complex series of evolutionary phases and interactions with their companion star. This path includes extended periods of steady mass loss during the lifetime of the star, dramatic mass loss during a supernova explosion, and mass transfer between the two stars. Each of these effects is determined by currently unknown physics. Understanding the physical processes governing this evolutionary path is a key goal of gravitational-wave astronomy. Extracting this information requires performing a simultaneous analysis of all of the observed signals while accounting for the observation bias. Individual events are characterized by assuming that the instrumental noise around the time of the merger is well understood. The observation bias is characterized by adding simulated signals to the observed data and counting what fraction of these signals are recovered.",6d7bf6098a1d8be1d21572a64e0c7ab94928fc43727b3e62db273050a33ccf89

Using this approach we have learned that: black holes between twenty and a hundred times the mass of the Sun exist and merge; a previously unobserved population. there is an excess of black holes approximately 35 times the mass of the Sun implying there is a characteristic mass scale to the processes of stellar evolution. most merging black holes rotate slowly, in contrast to black holes observed in the Milky Way. Previous research has shown that AI methods can solve gravitational-wave data analysis problems, in some cases far more efficiently than classical methods. However, these methods also struggle to deal with the large volume of data that will be available in the coming years. As a Schmidt fellow, I am working to combine theoretical knowledge about the signals we observe with simulation-based inference methods to overcome this limitation and allow us to leverage the growing catalog of binary black hole mergers fully. For example, while the statistical uncertainty in our inference decreases as the catalog grows, the systematic error intrinsic to our analysis method grows approximately quadratically with the size of the observed population. This systematic error is driven by the method used to account for the observational bias.",34b8c5eec9b6505aec7f0628758984b1e04c3310e6e4b6829346ac5bbdf71c28

I am currently working on using approximate Bayesian computation to analyze large sets of observations in a way that is less susceptible to systematic error. An open question in how to perform such analyses is how to efficiently represent the large volume of observed data. I am exploring how we can use theoretically motivated pre-processing stages to avoid the need for large embedding networks that are traditionally used. By combining this theoretical understanding of the problem with AI methods I hope to extract astrophysical insights from gravitational-wave observations with both more robustness and reduced computational cost.

Our bodies have developed little cellular armies that can take on all kinds of foes; they help to heal wounds, fight foreign invaders – like the common cold or COVID-19, and even battle cancer. There are many cell types that make up our immune systems, each having their own specialty. Some cells survey their native tissues, waiting for something insidious to come along. Other cells wait for the signal to build up their army – or proliferate – and mount an attack on that suspicious object. There are message-passing cells, killer cells, cells that act as weapon (or antibody) factories, cells that clean up the aftermath of an attack, and cells that keep the memory of the invader in case it’s ever seen again. A well-functioning immune system helps us to lead functional, long lives. However, our immune systems are not always well-oiled machines. Autoimmune conditions are disorders where the immune system starts to attack normal, otherwise healthy tissue. These conditions can affect tissues and organs from any part of the body, ranging from rheumatoid arthritis , which affects the tissue in small joints; to multiple sclerosis , which affects the protective covering of nerves; to type 1 diabetes , which affects the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

In patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis (an autoimmune condition that affects the kidneys), only about 15-20% of patients that are treated with existing therapies will respond to those therapies. And not responding to those therapies can have dire consequences – either a lifetime on dialysis or getting on a waitlist to receive a life-saving kidney transplant. To effectively treat these conditions, we must first better understand them. New methods for imaging immune cells in their native tissue are helping us to uncover the differences between patients who do and do not respond to the current standard of care. Until recently, we have studied immune cells by taking them out of the affected tissue and testing them. Using these new imaging methods, we can now look at the diverse set of soldiers in these dysfunctional cellular armies while their “formations” are still intact. To do this, a small piece of tissue is taken from the affected organ and imaged with up to 60 different cell-tagging molecules. The resulting images are rich and complex – so much so that a human cannot easily interpret them. This is where artificial intelligence (AI), and more specifically computer vision , saves the day. We train a specific type of AI algorithm called a convolutional neural network (CNN) to find the tens of thousands of cells in the image of that small sample of tissue.",6dc444eff03ff4a710f713eabde6213d884e9edeb98cc19802aea68b0acfb0b2

Once we have this detailed map of where all of the different tissue cells and immune cells are, we can look at differences between these maps in patients who did and did not respond to therapy. In lupus nephritis, we found that a high density of B cells (one specific type of immune cell) was associated with kidney survival – meaning those patients likely responded to therapy. Also, small groups of a specific subset of T cells (a different type of immune cell) meant that a patient’s disease would continue to progress, even when treated with the standard of care. Studying spatial immunity – or the spatial distribution of immune cells – is only possible with the advent of new computer vision methods, or clever applications of existing ones. AI has not just revolutionized this work, but built the foundations for it. As we create better models for mapping immune cells and their spatial relationships, we’ll continue to learn more about what happens when our immune system malfunctions, and hopefully better prepare therapies for when it does.

Understanding and accurately modeling chaotic dynamics is critical for addressing many problems in science and engineering. Machine learning models trained to emulate dynamical systems offer a promising new data-driven approach for developing fast and accurate models of chaotic dynamics. However, these trained models, often called emulators or surrogate models , sometimes struggle to properly capture chaos leading to unrealistic predictions. In our recent work published at NeurIPS 2023, we propose two new methods for training emulators to accurately model chaotic systems, including an approach inspired by methods in computer vision used for image recognition and generative AI. Machine learning approaches that use observational or experimental data to emulate dynamical systems have become increasingly popular over the past few years. These emulators aim to capture the dynamics of complex, high-dimensional systems like weather and climate. In principle, emulators will allow us to perform fast and accurate simulations for forecasting, uncertainty quantification, and parameter estimation. However, training emulators to model chaotic systems has proved to be tricky, especially in noisy settings.",5074c26fa3c07b6857300fa637ae37796620b70079193407d41b16204ac727d7

This means that even a tiny amount of noise in the data makes long-term forecasting impossible and precise short-term predictions very difficult. Accurate forecasts of chaotic systems, like the weather, are fundamentally limited by the properties of the chaos. If this is the case, should we simply give up on making long-term predictions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, even with machine learning, we will never be able to predict whether it will rain in Chicago more than a few weeks ahead of time (Sorry to all the couples planning outdoor summer weddings!). No, we should not give up completely because, while exact forecasts are impossible, we can still make useful statistical predictions about the future, such as the increasing frequency of hurricanes due to climate change. In fact, these statistical properties—collectively known as the chaotic attractor —are precisely what scientists focus on when developing models for chaotic systems. Despite these well-known properties of chaotic dynamics, most current approaches for training emulators still focus on short-term forecasting metrics such as the root mean squared error (RMSE).",72a45c6ec80b4a954521e7fc9c214cc50d9e62aa8a4e0813a975902d6d1d0d13

However, when using noisy or low-resolution data, which is the norm in real-world applications, these training methods often produce emulators that fail to capture the correct long-term statistical behaviors of the system. We address this problem by developing new training methods that encourage the emulator to match long-term statistical properties of the chaotic dynamics—which, again, we refer to as the chaotic attractor. We propose two approaches for achieving this: Physics-informed Optimal Transport : Choose a set of relevant summary statistics based on expert knowledge: for example, a climate scientist might pick the global mean temperature or the frequency of hurricanes. Then, during training, use an optimal transport metric—a way of quantifying discrepancies between distributions—to match the distribution of the summary statistics produced by the emulator to the distribution seen in the data. Unsupervised Contrastive Learning : Automatically choose relevant statistics that characterize the chaotic attractor by using contrastive learning , a machine learning approach initially developed for learning useful image representations for image recognition tasks and generative AI. Then, during training, match the learned relevant statistics of the emulator to the statistics of the data.",76ad3e5744cc4c50d9c7d09707bf47055f9427c65a29288f290f89a7227f2214

In both cases, we train emulators to generate predictions that match the long-term statistics of the data rather than just short-term forecasts. This results in much more robust emulators that, even when trained on noisy data, produce predictions with the same statistical properties as the real underlying chaotic dynamics. The best we can hope for when modeling chaos is either short-term forecasts or long-term statistical predictions, and emulators trained using the newly proposed methods give us the best of both worlds. Emulators are already being used in a wide range of applications such as weather prediction, climate modeling, fluid dynamics, and biophysics. Our approach and other promising recent developments in emulator design and training are bringing us closer to the goal of having fast, accurate, and perhaps even interpretable data-driven models for complex dynamical systems, which will help us answer many basic scientific questions as well as solve challenging engineering problems.

Every year, about 500 million tons of plastic are produced, most of which originate from petrochemical sources and end up as waste. Not only does this immense volume of plastic not decompose for centuries, but it also frequently escapes proper disposal, leading to environmental pollution. A stark example is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch , a massive accumulation of plastic in the Pacific Ocean. To put this pollution in perspective, if this patch were made entirely of typical 10-gram shopping bags, it would amount to approximately 10 billion bags, exceeding the human population on Earth. However, it’s crucial to recognize that not all plastics are inherently harmful. They are incredibly versatile and economical, finding use in everything from everyday clothing and packaging to essential roles in micro-electronics, medical devices, and even battery electrolytes. Our goal, therefore, isn’t to eliminate plastics altogether but to explore sustainable alternatives and rethink our reliance on single-use items. The path forward involves making plastics more sustainable. This could be achieved by using plant-based materials, ensuring compostability, or improving recyclability.

To address this challenge, science is rapidly advancing in the exploration of new materials through automated experimentation, computer simulations, and machine learning. However, these methods require a universal language to describe polymeric materials understandable to both computers and human scientists. This brings us to the core of what makes plastics unique: polymers. Derived from the Greek words ‘πολύς’ (many) and ‘μέρος’ (parts), polymers are long molecules composed of repeating units called monomers. For instance, simplified polyethylene , the material of common shopping bags, is essentially a long chain of carbon atoms. Visualizing the structure of a polymer like polyethylene can be straightforward for someone with a chemistry background.

However, traditional SMILES doesn’t address the varying lengths of polymers, as a real polymer chain consists of thousands of carbon atoms. Writing them all out would be impractical and overwhelming. This challenge is elegantly solved by a notation specifically designed for polymers, known as BigSMILES . It represents the repeating nature of monomers in a compact and understandable form. For instance, a simplified version of polyethylene can be represented as: {[] [$]CC[$] []} This format not only makes it easier for humans and machines to interpret but also allows for more detailed specification of connections and types of monomers, reflecting a wide range of realistic polymeric materials. One crucial aspect not yet addressed is the variation in the length of polymer chains in a material, known as the molecular weight distribution . This is where the generative version of BigSMILES, G-BigSMILES, comes into play.

This isn’t a distant dream but a possibility being unlocked by groundbreaking research in lithium metal batteries. The key? A novel electrolyte solution that promises to revolutionize how these batteries operate. Rechargeable lithium batteries are a cornerstone of modern portable electronics, offering a reliable power source for a wide range of devices. At their core, these batteries consist of three key components: an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte that enables the flow of lithium ions between the anode and cathode during charging (that converts chemical energy into the desirable electrical energy) and discharging (electrical to chemical energy) cycles. The unique chemistry of these batteries allows them to be recharged repeatedly, making them both efficient and environmentally friendly compared to single-use alternatives. This ability to efficiently store and release electrical energy is what has propelled lithium batteries to the forefront of energy storage technology. The specific variant of lithium batteries that ubiquitously powers all electronic gadgets and electric vehicles (EVs) is called a lithium-ion battery. A lithium-ion battery consists of graphite (a form of carbon, the other popular form of carbon you may know as diamond!) as anode and a ceramic solid (mostly contains metal, lithium, and oxygen) and the electrolyte consists of salts (not the one you use in your soup!) dissolved in organic liquids.",090d0a84c48afbceef625194fed471aeb5fb4b36fbe1006958c265d3b8b2be05

However, as we push the boundaries of technology and seek more sustainable and efficient energy solutions, the limitations of lithium-ion batteries become apparent. For example, the driving range of EVs is currently limited by the amount of lithium that can be stored in graphite anode in the lithium-ion batteries. This is where the next generation of batteries, such as lithium metal batteries (LMBs) , comes into the picture. LMBs promise even higher energy densities, potentially doubling that of standard lithium-ion batteries as they use lithium metal instead of graphite as the anode, and offer faster charging times. This makes them particularly attractive for applications requiring more intensive energy storage, like long-range EVs and more efficient integration with renewable energy sources. However, their widespread use of LMBs is hampered by two major challenges. The first major challenge lies in the selection of electrolyte, which is crucial for enabling the flow of lithium ions and hence in the generation of electrical energy. The traditional electrolytes used in lithium ion batteries show increased reactivity towards lithium metal anode. They often fail to support the efficient movement of lithium ions and contribute to the rapid degradation of the lithium electrode. This incompatibility significantly hinders the battery’s performance and lifespan.",7f12c5e5b789f4645ef6a7c923cb91bf9af1f75d6a8e30cc7094dccfd6181115

This unevenness often results in the formation of lithium ‘dendrites,’ needle-like structures that can grow through the electrolyte layer. These dendrites not only reduce the efficiency and lifespan of the battery but also pose significant safety risks. They can create short circuits within the battery, leading to potential failures or, in extreme cases, safety hazards. The exciting news? We have developed a new type of electrolyte solvent, the fluorinated borate esters , which dramatically enhances the performance and safety of lithium metal batteries, in a recent work published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A . Figure : Development of next-generation batteries such as lithium metal batteries can significantly increase the driving range of current electric vehicles by manyfold. The main bottleneck to the realization of such next-generation batteries is the lack of suitable electrolytes. Our research team ( Amanchukwu Lab ) experimentally synthesized a novel electrolyte called tris(2-fluoroethyl) borate (TFEB), a fluorinated borate ester, and investigated for compatibility with LMBs through a series of experimental battery cycling tests. While our cycling tests validated the promising nature of the new electrolytes for LMBs, supporting our initial hypothesis, it presented a challenge: we could not explain our experimental results in terms of molecular behavior and interactions.",da71c58d53647a1e877c8f18139e2da119d9cbf7495a6f085f48f5b9f1ecd4be

This molecular insight is crucial because it allows us to predict and design the behavior of similar high-performance electrolytes in future experiments. In essence, gaining a clear molecular-level understanding is key to systematically developing electrolytes that can enhance the performance and safety of LMBs. To overcome this challenge, we turned towards cutting-edge computational methods, including quantum chemistry-based density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. These tools allowed us to delve deep into the molecular interactions within the battery, providing insights into the ion solvation (i.e., how lithium ions bond to different molecular components in electrolytes that ultimately decide their properties) environment and the solubility of lithium salts (this is crucial since electrolytes do not work unless salts dissolve in the organic liquids) in fluorinated borate esters. The implications of this research are far-reaching. With improved solubility and stability offered by TFEB, LMBs can operate more efficiently and safely, paving the way for their use in a variety of applications, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles. Additionally, this study opens the door for future research where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can play a pivotal role.",98cd754094e000fc9e30e859211257c7da1b821293d7144fa6838602c40aa984

This makes them less feasible for exploring the vast chemical space of potential electrolyte candidates, which is astonishingly large, estimated to be in the order of 10ˆ60 possibilities! Here’s where AI algorithms can make a substantial impact. These advanced technologies have the potential to revolutionize how we approach the discovery of new electrolyte solvents. AI and ML are not just faster; they are capable of analyzing complex patterns and data relationships that are beyond human computational ability. This means they can predict, simulate, and optimize the properties of new electrolyte materials much more quickly and accurately than traditional methods. By leveraging AI, we can dramatically speed up the discovery process, potentially leading to breakthroughs in the development of more efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions. Our team is excited to be at the forefront of this innovation. We are actively exploring the use of AI and ML algorithms to tackle this grand challenge.

This poses a challenge for machine learning due to the sensitivity of coordinates to 3D rotations, translations, and inversions (the symmetries of 3D Euclidean space). Euclidean symmetry-equivariant Neural Networks (E(3)NNs) are specifically designed to address this issue. They faithfully capture the symmetries of physical systems, handle 3D geometry, and operate on the scalar, vector, and tensor fields that characterize these systems. E(3)NNs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on diverse atomistic benchmarks, such as small molecule properties, protein-ligand binding, and force prediction for heterogeneous catalysis.",d9be70c9097b9ded084d7c2f5a0bab779720fd0dfddf3a943ba4c6bec9d55131

Talk Abstract: Investing in applied machine learning without understanding the underlying foundations is like investing in healthcare without understanding biology. Foundational research has had a tremendous impact on machine learning, from optimization methodology to privacy protections and from data acquisition strategies to uncertainty quantification. Understanding machine learning foundations has also deepened our insights into longstanding challenges in statistics, optimization theory, numerical simulations, and engineering. We have yet to witness the full impact of these foundational developments. In this talk, I will highlight several major examples of these foundations and their impacts on theory, practice, and workforce development. Furthermore, we will explore emerging directions in machine learning for which new theory is necessary and where future foundational research is likely to play a critical role, including scientific discovery and ensuring machine learning methods are fair, safe, equitable, and sustainable.

But AI also creates new barriers in science, as advanced technical expertise is often required to access, evaluate, and use advanced AI models in research. A $3.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation awarded to a team of scientists from the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, and MIT will seek to lower these barriers with a new framework inspired by one of the oldest technologies: gardens. Working with researchers from materials science, physics, and chemistry, the team led by Ian Foster will create “Model Gardens” that publish and curate AI models, link them with data and computing resources, and make it simple for users to test and deploy these powerful tools in their own studies. The Garden team, which also includes Ben Blaiszik of UChicago and Argonne, Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli of MIT, Eliu Huerta of Argonne, and Rebecca Willett of UChicago, hopes that the platform will increase usage of AI models for research and education, advancing scientific discovery, reproducibility, and collaboration. “The Garden is a place where a community can be built around AI in science,” said Blaiszik, Researcher in Data Science and Learning at Globus Labs .",15660e7bfaaae74da64340beac03ad1a23fcafb6725729e0fca7f2e2569848fa

A chemist might train a model on molecular data to find promising candidates for a new drug treatment or materials for a new technology. Astronomers and high-energy physicists use AI to detect rare events in the massive amounts of data collected by their instruments, and as a guide for where future experiments should look. Creating these models requires access to large datasets and powerful computers, making them difficult to replicate, share, and repurpose for outside studies. Model Gardens provides a repository for models where they can be linked to papers, testing metrics, known model limitations, and code, plus computing and data storage resources through tools such as funcX and Globus . The combination creates “containers” where scientific models can be run easily from anywhere, accessing NSF-funded data and computing resources through the cloud. “The NSF has been making important investments in AI through large AI institutes and other programs.",b0a7aad61d2938396eef9d35a3ff7464dd322dd0c23945c17a75f1ac2028f9ad

Collaborators include scientists working on projects at the Large Hadron Collider and U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratories exploring the frontiers of high-energy physics and designing new therapeutics and advanced materials. After contributors upload their models to the garden, the framework will run automated tests and screens to validate their accuracy and performance, publishing all results to an information-rich web page describing a model’s features. The framework also generates containers and APIs so that other scientists can easily access the models and their linked data, often via just a few lines of programming code. “A user can come to the Garden and see all that information at a glance,” Blaiszik said.",f45222677fb21e6b12ae59aec21566a5b5f7183873f45670f8cda07d161ca05e

By lowering the technical barriers and resource limitations for finding and deploying AI-based scientific models, the framework enables students to work directly with these methods, either as part of a course or in their own research projects. “AI training is vital for the next generation of scientists,” said Willett, Professor of Statistics and Computer Science at UChicago and Faculty Director of AI at the Data Science Institute. “If we can make datasets and models trivially available, then AI methods become much more accessible to students. You can immediately see how to use different models, how they perform, and potential failure modes. It gives a student a much more tangible experience than they would get otherwise.” Model Gardens was funded through the NSF Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) program, grant #2209892 .

Clouds play a crucial role in the Earth’s radiation budget—the balance between incoming and outgoing energy that regulates the temperature of our planet. But their behavior under future climate change is not well understood. Potential changes in cloud properties are the primary source of uncertainty in climate projections. A team of scientists from UChicago and Argonne has set out to create tools that will let us tap into decades of satellite images to understand cloud behavior. They will use state-of-the-art computer vision and machine-learning technology to classify cloud textures and patterns, and look at how those patterns have changed over time.

The origin and fate of the universe are encoded in galaxies, exploding stars, the cosmic microwave background and the billions of other objects we observe in the sky. Through cosmic survey experiments, scientists are able to observe, analyze and simulate these objects—which allows them to discover and refine the fundamental theories of cosmic evolution. Researchers at Fermilab and UChicago are using AI to automate a tool for the design, optimization and forecasting of cosmic survey experiments. The tool currently requires users to set parameters by hand for each aspect of an experiment. By automating it, scientists will make it more reliable and efficient. In the long term, they’ll significantly lower the cost of experiments and make more discovery possible. The principal investigators for this project are Yuxin Chen, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, and Brian Nord, an associate scientist at Fermilab.

Since its founding in 2018, the nonprofit has brought its “Get Out the Vote” organizing efforts to communities across the state in order to remove hurdles to obtaining a ballot in North Dakota. North Dakota Native Vote (NDNV) also works toward building Indigenous data sovereignty, or the right of Indigenous people to govern the collection, ownership and application of its own data, particularly in the context of building electoral power and improving outcomes for Native communities in North Dakota. DSI and NDNV connected in early 2024 with support from the 11th Hour Project , a program of the Schmidt Family Foundation with relationships with both groups. As this partnership has grown, NDNV has successfully launched new data tools to support their voter education and elections organizing work. The pilot framework developed by NDNV and DSI includes two core components, the ‘Pledge to Vote’ data collection infrastructure and an interactive elections information map , which NDNV is using in its grassroots organizing leading up to the election. “North Dakota Native Vote plans to use this platform and data to understand voter turnout, analyze policy impacts, identify barriers to voting, and address critical issues affecting our tribal communities that limit voter participation and voter confidence,” said Nicole Donaghy, Executive Director of North Dakota Native Vote.",92cd5a5ad340c369b5b42bb6a89858a96797216377ab2b0e704fc01b4c5a4c57

The Native Vote in every state has the power to determine election outcomes, we must learn to understand that political power, and demonstrate it to our communities.” Over the course of this year, the DSI team, led by Susan Paykin, Associate Director of Community-Centered Data Science with Research Assistant Athmika Senthilkumar (Harris MPP ‘25), worked with Donaghy and NDNV Program Director Devero Yellow Earring, to scope, refine, and launch a pilot project supporting their 2024 Election “Get Out The Vote” effort. Importantly, each stage of the project was analyzed by NDNV and DSI for potential issues around equity and data sovereignty, with regular check-ins to discuss how to create improvements. The pilot project centers on a custom data collection framework that integrates into NDNV’s existing grassroots organizing systems and aims to address systemic challenges around voter identification requirements in North Dakota. North Dakota is the only U.S. state that does not require residents to register to vote, but it does require residents to present an ID in order to vote. In 2017, the state legislated new voter ID requirements that require presenting a “valid form of identification” before voting.",bdadccfa185bc471782b40183b701bc1138f90e6c210388eb79ef0dc8f8be482

These ID restrictions have had a disproportionate impact on Indigenous people in North Dakota, as state systems are less likely to officially recognize the home address of Indigenous residents, particularly on reservations lands or in rural areas. North Dakota Native Vote wanted to address this challenge to voter rights by making it easier to present proof of residential addresses, while building out their own database on Indigenous voters and their concerns. NDNV also wanted to use data to analyze how policy and lack of information affects representation and voter turnout on reservations. A key contribution of the ‘Pledge to Vote’ infrastructure is that it utilizes a technique called ‘reverse geocoding’, which allows residents to find their location on the map and translates that location into geographic coordinates and a residential street address. Technologically significant, the tool is also optimized to work “offline”, or in low-internet, rural areas, which is important for NDNV’s field work which covers remote areas. It uses open source software and technologies, which keeps costs low without sacrificing privacy or accountability. The interactive map shows voting resources across the state including electoral precinct information, county auditor information, and more.

Along with any major election, the electorate can expect a bevy of debates and political speeches from candidates. The 2024 election candidates include former President Donald Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Previous reporting on Trump from prior campaigns has pointed to his distinctive language and claimed that it’s unlike any previous candidates’ language, but is that really true? In a new paper, authors from the University of Chicago quantify the uniqueness of Trump using several metrics and tools, including large language models (LLMs). Doctoral student Karen Zhou, who is advised by Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Data Science Chenhao Tan , led the research, to be published at PNAS Nexus. “This work was inspired by the desire to quantify the differences between Donald Trump and prior American presidents,” Zhou stated. “In particular, we hypothesized that portrayal of political opponents might be a distinguishing feature of his speech.” Zhou and her co-authors developed a new language measurement technique and found that Donald Trump’s use of language is indeed unique among all presidential candidates since 1960. They categorized Trump’s language as divisive, particularly when mentioning political opponents. To support such claims, the authors had to create tools up to the challenge. They implemented three complementary approaches to allow for a multifaceted comparison. One of the approaches employed an innovative use of a large language model (LLM).",6028cea6d945405285df2f774ae62488ffbf32e551704bed4114ab377394ad44

Based on the ability of LLMs to make these predictions, the authors created a metric called “uniqueness” that measured an individual’s probability of word phrases or sequences compared to other political candidates. For this group of political candidates, this measure compares how likely one speaker is to use the same language and phrasing as another candidate. “This is quite a creative way of using large language models,” Tan said. “The common practice is to evaluate large language models by how well it predicts the next word, but this approach uses large language models to inspect the political discourse.” The second measure employed in this paper was a standardized definition of “divisive speech.” Defined as language meant to delegitimize or challenge the speaker’s target, classic divisive speech examples include calling a political opponent “stupid,” or “racist,” or “ridiculous.” The researchers created a lexicon of 178 words that are readily recognized as divisive and could be used by political figures regardless of party affiliation. The third measurement employed by the authors was specifically interested in speech directed at a debate opponent. The authors selected mentions of opponents from presidential debates and calculated how a speaker’s rhetoric changes when referring to opponents versus in other political speech.",0ae346524ce2e397d69d8c3532e88ea8cd0b97ff6b8d06604862ec33e640af8a

Even when just comparing Trump to the average performance of both Democrat and Republican speakers, Trump remained an anomaly. Similarly, using the lexicon of divisive words, Trump was found to employ divisive language most frequently. In campaign speeches, he was particularly likely to use “crazy” (135 times), “corrupt” (111 times), and “stupid” (69 times). His most divisive language appeared during debates, but he ranked as the most divisive across all forms of political speech measured here. Finally, Trump was more likely than others to mention his political opponents specifically. And when talking about his opponents, he referred to them with more distinctive language than other candidates did.",79af7aee4528b57f929ee93268b91ec4d944a68edf2e9bd864fd595020fded44

But at least when it comes to language use, Trump is an outlier case. Since the early 1960s, there hasn’t been a political candidate quite like him. And we now have data across three separate measures that demonstrates that. “Presidential speech has far-reaching social effects,” Zhou said. “ It is important to identify the features of such rhetoric so that we can measure their impacts, especially for Donald Trump, who many intuitively consider an outlier politician.” A preprint version is available here .

Lum’s career to date spans work at Twitter, the Human Rights Data Analysis Group , the University of Pennsylvania, and Virginia Tech. She is a founding member of the Executive Committee of the ACM conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) — the premier venue for work on the societal impacts of algorithmic systems — and was named an Emerging Leader in Statistics by the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies and a Kavli Fellow by the National Academy of Sciences. Her research includes the development of new statistical methods and open source software packages for fairness, record linkage, and population estimation. She has assessed models used for predictive policing and risk assessment, finding that such software often reinforces or amplifies racial bias in law enforcement and incarceration, and worked with advocacy and legal groups around their usage. Lum’s pivot into social impact work began with an impromptu email during graduate school to Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) director Patrick Ball, offering to help with their work on estimating casualties during civil conflicts and humanitarian crises around the world. “I wanted to do something with more connection to the real world, because a lot of my research in graduate school was very methodological, but really driven by applications,” Lum said.",0d0441c521ce06869851bf896a649d43c6008207809b3ef9f250a9da63cb21a5

She later joined the technology startup DataPad (founded by pandas creator Wes McKinney), and did data science consulting work for companies ranging from small startups to eBay. But it was when Lum returned to HRDAG to lead their criminal justice efforts that she found her passion for technically scrutinizing the algorithms increasingly used to make decisions with major human consequences. Her work found that commercial software models to “predict crime” and target police activity carry over the biases of the data they are trained on, leading to feedback loops of disproportionate policing in historically over-policed communities . That work, as well as studies of the risk assessment tools used in setting bail for people charged with crimes, led her to partner with judicial districts and public defender organizations in New York and Philadelphia. “I think often the role I play is sort of a translator,” Lum said.",99271cb47d6a0947dc1cd51f128f27d247ddb10673418bc8307d6f6a5ba56200

In one session, Lum organized a conversation with a person who was detained pretrial based on algorithmic risk assessment, creating a platform to tell their story to a room full of machine learning experts used to working with abstracted data. “I do see that as one of the big impacts I had, because I think it changed in some ways how that community of people thought about working in that area,” Lum said.

When you associate an address or coordinates with a data point, it becomes spatial data, opening up new possibilities and challenges for analysis. With the right approaches and tools, spatial data scientists can track the spread of a disease , study the impact of COVID-19 on households , or assess environmental health across neighborhoods – offering rich new insights for policymakers, communities, and other stakeholders. The Open Spatial Lab (OSL), a collaboration of the Data Science Institute and the Center for Spatial Data Science , is a new hub for the tools and partnerships essential for maximizing the potential of these approaches. In its inaugural year, the OSL, led by Dylan Halpern and Susan Paykin, will work with community partners in Chicago and across the United States to understand their data science needs and activate their spatial data for community and policy decision support. It also develops open source tools, projects, and resources that can be shared among researchers and organizations working in the spatial data science space. For the lab’s founding philosophy, Halpern and Paykin chose a quote from legendary designers Charles and Ray Eames: “The best for the most for the least.” “We’re focused on making these methods, tools, and applications more accessible to broader audiences,” said Paykin, the program lead for Open Spatial Lab.",6056241aed28f7cd9bf7b2514884cae002fd99a79e36f893eecdb3f66b0d6d9a

Those resources will be shared through the OSL Hub , a networked knowledge base with tutorials, templates, project examples, and guides to download or learn about tools, programming languages, and data science methods. Users can learn how to use Turf.js, a Javascript library for analyzing and manipulating geographic data, read about the concept of spatial autocorrelation, or tinker with Matico , an open source software platform for spatial data management and dashboard building led by Stuart Lynn at Center for Spatial Data Science.

We’re also thinking about how these tools can be thoughtfully put together so that they’re cheap or free to own long term, and something that organizations can manage and doesn’t have to be this huge burden moving forward.” In addition to the hub, Open Spatial Lab will work directly with organizations who have projects that could benefit from spatial data science. Through their Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant, they’ll connect with partners in the public health, health equity, and racial equity space. Locally, OSL will plug in with efforts such as the South Side Civic Scopeathon to find Chicago community groups that work with spatial data. “What works really well with our approach is when there’s some sort of place-based or spatial component, which many of these projects have because they are by nature interested in outcomes in different neighborhoods, or how land is developed within a city in a racially equitable way, or ensuring different health outcomes are equitable across cities,” Paykin said.",dffac3197060d9de5e609956c9dad67acc314d683ce926e36453473a77caffb8

Going beyond entropy regularization, we design a novel policy optimization method that accommodates various choices of regularizers by leveraging Bregman divergence and mirror descent and provably works even when the regularizer lacks strong convexity and smoothness. In the presence of multiple agents, the goal of policy optimization is to find an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE), preferably through an independent learning process. Noticeably, existing analyses on learning NE for competitive games fall short of characterizing the last-iterate of the learning algorithm in a dimension-free manner. We make progress by designing novel extragradient policy optimization methods that converge to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) of competitive games at a dimension-free linear rate, enabling learning approximate NE without introducing additional assumptions typically needed in prior results. We further extend our algorithms and the accompanying analysis to competitive Markov games and multi-player zero-sum polymatrix games.

To address this complexity and evaluate the repurposing potential of antihypertensives with different mechanisms of action, we deployed a causal inference approach accounting for the competing risk of death in emulated clinical trials using two distinct electronic health record (EHR) systems, one from the UK Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) and the other from the US Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR). We performed intention-to-treat analyses among patients aged 50 or older at baseline, applying Inverse Propensity score of Treatment Weighting to balance the two treatment arms with respect to a set of confounders curated by cardiologists and neurologists. Specifically, we compared antihypertensive treatment initiation with any of seven ARBs vs any of eleven ACE inhibitors. In the US RPDR database, a total of 45,206 patients were eligible to participate in the emulated target trial. Treatment initiation with any of the seven ARBs was associated with lower hazard of all-cause mortality (HR=1.16 [95% CI: 1.10-1.23]) and lower cause-specific hazard of dementia onset (HR=1.34 [95% CI: 1.27-1.42]) in cause-specific Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models, after accounting for prolonged survival, relative to treatment initiation with any of the eleven ACE inhibitors.",623a79978af40d641f308c473419551b56a8a2932024c9d380b9dbe2828aa25f

Results of the competing risks analysis were robust to the structure of the outcome models (i.e., Cox PH vs nonparametric). The directionality and strength of our findings were similar in the UK CPRD database. Target trial emulations in two large-scale EHR systems suggest that treatment initiation with BBB-crossing ARBs might reduce the risk of dementia among hypertensive patients.

However, this is a nonconvex task, and a result, iterative optimization methods such as hypergradient descent lack global optimality guarantees in general. We propose an online nonstochastic control methodology for mathematical optimization. First, we formalize the setting of meta-optimization, an online learning formulation of learning the best optimization algorithm from a class of methods. The meta-optimization problem over gradient-based methods can be framed as a feedback control problem over the choice of hyperparameters, including the learning rate, momentum, and the preconditioner. Although the original optimal control problem is nonconvex, we show how recent methods from online nonstochastic control using convex relaxations can be used to overcome the challenge of nonconvexity, and obtain regret guarantees against the best offline solution. This guarantees that in meta-optimization, given a sequence of optimization problems, we can learn a method that attains convergence comparable to that of the best optimization method in hindsight from a class of methods. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that our meta-optimization algorithm can continuously improve given problem instances, and become competitive with the best tuned method among a class of methods.

Talk Title: Flat minima generalize for low-rank matrix recovery Abstract: Empirical evidence suggests that for a variety of overparameterized nonlinear models, most notably in neural network training, the growth of the loss around a minimizer strongly impacts its performance. Flat minima — those around which the loss grows slowly — appear to generalize well. This work takes a step towards understanding this phenomenon by focusing on the simplest class of overparameterized nonlinear models: those arising in low-rank matrix recovery. We analyze overparameterized matrix and bilinear sensing, robust PCA, covariance matrix estimation, and single hidden layer neural networks with quadratic activation functions. In all cases, we show that flat minima, measured by the trace of the Hessian, exactly recover the ground truth under standard statistical assumptions.

Talk Title: The Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness Abstract: The field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last decade, several formal, mathematical definitions of fairness have gained prominence. Here we first assemble and categorize these definitions into two broad families: (1) those that constrain the effects of decisions on disparities; and (2) those that constrain the effects of legally protected characteristics, like race and gender, on decisions. We then show, analytically and empirically, that both families of definitions typically result in strongly Pareto dominated decision policies. For example, in the case of college admissions, adhering to popular formal conceptions of fairness would simultaneously result in lower student-body diversity and a less academically prepared class, relative to what one could achieve by explicitly tailoring admissions policies to achieve desired outcomes. In this sense, requiring that these fairness definitions hold can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect.",995f39e183c3902ce7d7e4c500572db83c64792defb719cd68adfedc0cdc0886

Talk Title: Exploring and Learning in Sparse Linear MDPs without Computationally Intractable Oracles Abstract: The key assumption underlying linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is that the learner has access to a known feature map from state-action pairs to d-dimensional vectors, and that the rewards and transitions are linear functions in this representation. But where do these features come from? In the absence of expert domain knowledge, a tempting strategy is to use the “kitchen sink” approach and hope that the true features are included in a much larger set of potential features. In this work we revisit linear MDPs from the perspective of feature selection. In a k-sparse linear MDP, there is an unknown subset of size k containing all the relevant features, and the goal is to learn a near-optimal policy in only poly(k, log d) interactions with the environment.",ac8839d9e3bbc22b0ebe3764389f683f7f352140f8534528977ea5d18934abe3

Talk Title: Model-free selective inference with conformal p-values and its application in drug discovery Abstract: In decision-making or scientific discovery pipelines such as job hiring and drug discovery, before any resource-intensive step, there is often an initial screening step that uses predictions from a machine learning model to shortlist a few candidates from a large pool. We introduce a framework that allows using any prediction model to select candidates whose unobserved outcomes exceed user-specified values, while rigorously controlling the false positives. Given a set of calibration data that are exchangeable with the test sample, we leverage conformal inference ideas to construct p-values that allow us to shortlist candidates with exact false discovery rate (FDR) control. In addition, I will discuss new ideas to further deal with covariate shifts between calibration and test samples, a scenario that occurs in almost all such problems including drug discovery, hiring, causal inference, and healthcare. Our methods are flexible wrappers around any complex model. In practical drug discovery tasks, our methods greatly narrow the set of promising drug candidates to manageable sizes while maintaining rigorous FDR control.",dfe8859c70adad79837c7082b5f2a027fc5485fe7ae83d15c443d692ff7690bd

To bridge these systems, we propose to use generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs decompose complex outcomes into separable component functions, creating a modular structure that fits seamlessly into LLM context windows. As a result, GAMs can unleash the power of LLMs for traditional machine learning tasks. We demonstrate an exciting application of this perspective: automated surprise finding. Real-world data science grapples with complications like hidden confounding, often necessitating manual model inspections by domain experts. For instance, treatment-based confounding in medical data may inadvertently teach data- driven systems to perpetuate inherent biases. However, by bridging GAMs with LLMs, we harness the vast knowledge reservoir within LLMs to auto-detect anomalies that appear to contradict domain expertise. This approach not only improves machine learning models, but also reveals quirks of the underlying system. Using this combination of glass-box GAMs and foundational LLMs, we evaluate four datasets of real-world medical evidence, identifying two characteristic types of medical biases: (1) discontinuous risk at sharp treatment thresholds and (2) counter-causal paradoxes where aggressive treatment reduces perceived risk.",7121f38b436d945f85b9197a1584cd53e5cb17841e449f3dcfa0406bd098288e

We propose a model of sampling bias called Gamma-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor.",d7c47f2b6bb754de9f9081003bebb85c14e3849c2681cdf1bc602dce973734d7

Because of the growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike professional educators, struggle to effectively address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities for students. In this work, we explore the potential for LLMs to assist math tutors in remediating student mistakes. We analyze thousands of tutoring sessions from novice tutors, which reveal poor pedagogical practices like immediately saying and explaining the solution when responding to student mistakes. We used these findings to build ReMath, a benchmark co-developed with experienced math teachers that deconstructs their thought process for remediation. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art instruct-tuned and dialog models on ReMath. Our findings suggest that although models consistently improve upon original tutor responses, we cannot rely on models alone to remediate mistakes. Providing models with the error type (e.g., the student is guessing) and strategy (e.g., simplify the problem) leads to a 75% improvement in the response quality over models without that information. Nonetheless, despite the improvement, the quality of the best model’s responses still falls short of experienced math teachers. Our work is the first to shed light on the potential and current limitations of using LLMs to provide high-quality learning experiences for both tutors and students at scale.

Talk Title: What creates edge of stability, balancing, and catapult Abstract: When large learning rate is used in gradient descent for nonconvex optimization, various phenomena that are not explainable by classical optimization theory can arise, including edge of stability, balancing, and catapult. There are a lot of theoretical works trying to analyze these phenomena, while the high level idea is still missing: it is unclear when and why these phenomena occur. In this talk, I will show that these phenomena are actually various tips of the same iceberg. They occur when the objective function of optimization has some good regularity. This regularity, together with the effect of large learning rate on guiding gradient descent from sharp regions to flatter ones, leads to the control of the largest eigenvalue of Hessian, i.e., sharpness, along the GD trajectory, which results in various phenomena.",d5855b421125d933e7d648cd3afc655281cf14ffeb7fcfc799ded4338e2179fb

In particular, greater environmental prestige leads to larger faculty-led research groups, which drive higher faculty productivity, primarily in disciplines with group collaboration norms. In contrast, productivity does not increase substantially with prestige for faculty publications without group members or for group members themselves.

Recent history has illuminated numerous examples where these algorithms proved unreliable or inequitable. We take a principled approach to the use of machine learning in societally high-stakes settings, guided by three pillars: validity, equity, and oversight. We address data problems that challenge the validity of algorithmic decision support systems by developing methods for algorithmic risk assessments that account for selection bias, confounding, and bandit feedback. We conduct audits for bias throughout the systems in which algorithms are used to inform decision-making. Throughout we propose novel methods that use doubly-robust techniques for bias correction. We apply our methods to the consumer lending context where we find that use of our methods could extend lending opportunities to applicants from historically underbanked regions without an increase in the average rate of default.

Providing safety and performance guarantees for motion planning and control algorithms is a well-studied problem for robotic systems with well-known dynamics that operate in structured environments.

Crucially, our algorithm does not require any oracle knowledge of whether a d-separator is observed. We also generalize this adaptivity to other conditions, such as the front-door criterion.

Our methodology includes word frequencies, topic modeling, supervised classification, and consideration of metadata such as likes or shares. Each technique reveals interesting, yet sometimes conflicting, insights; for example, independent outlets are more likely to use war-related words, but state-affiliated outlets discuss war-related topics more.

Next, we study the global minima selection dynamics—the process that an optimizer leaves bad minima for good ones—in two settings. For a manifold of minima around which the loss function grows quadratically, we derive effective exploration dynamics on the manifold for SGD and Adam, using a quasistatic approach.

Talk Title: Digital Doubles of Everything (Even You) Talk Abstract: Scientists have long made and interrogated doubles of reality. Often developed to describe narrow aspects of otherwise immense systems, traditional models have always been relatively poor substitutes for the bewildering tangle of complexity that pervades the world. However, the rise of AI allows scientists to generate and interrogate increasingly sophisticated digitized captures of entire systems of interest. These “digital doubles” represent everything from system I/O to complete characterizations of internal mechanisms and processes. In this project, we argue that the opportunity with doubles of many such systems is not just expedient exploration or accurate prediction. Instead, it is to combine them, represent interactions between them faithfully, and even enable them to interrogate and explore one another. We probe the possibility of developing digital doubles of dynamic systems of knowledge, values, and commitments, as well as using these doubles to operationalize and automate a logic of anomaly detection and correction, not only in our data but in our theoretical and normative, non-epistemic commitments.

Talk Title: Identifiable deep generative models via sparse decoding Talk Abstract: We develop the sparse VAE for unsupervised representation learning on high-dimensional data. The sparse VAE learns a set of latent factors (representations) which summarize the associations in the observed data features. The underlying model is sparse in that each observed feature (i.e. each dimension of the data) depends on a small subset of the latent factors. As examples, in ratings data each movie is only described by a few genres; in text data each word is only applicable to a few topics; in genomics, each gene is active in only a few biological processes. We prove such sparse deep generative models are identifiable: with infinite data, the true model parameters can be learned. (In contrast, most deep generative models are not identifiable.) We empirically study the sparse VAE with both simulated and real data. We find that it recovers meaningful latent factors and has smaller heldout reconstruction error than related methods.

Talk Title: Understanding scientific fields via network analysis and topic modeling Talk Abstract: As scientific disciplines get larger and more complex, it becomes impossible for an individual researcher to be familiar with the entire body of literature. This forces them to specialize in a sub-field, and unfortunately such insulation can hinder the birth of ideas that arise from new connections, eventually slowing down scientific progress. As such, discovering fruitful interdisciplinary connections by analyzing scientific publications is an important problem in the science of science. This talk will present several past and ongoing projects towards answering that question using tools from network analysis and topic modeling: 1) a dynamic-embedding-based method for link prediction in a machine learning/AI semantic network, 2) finding communities in cognitive science that study similar topics but do not cite each other or publish in the same venues, and 3) developing theoretically grounded hypergraph embedding methods to capture surprising collaborations or missed opportunities.",7cd957e354ecd286c766c8c4ccd23e75a391b091b24df2ea59a5989f89491dc2

We present a convolutional neural network method for fast supernova time-series classification, with observed brightness data smoothed in both the wavelength and time directions with Gaussian process regression.

To date, researchers have developed a plethora of theories, algorithms and systems that are successful in answering what and who questions on graphs. Despite the remarkable progress, unfairness often occurs in many graph mining algorithms, hindering the deployment of graph mining algorithms in high-stake applications.

In this presentation, we propose to tackle this question from a convex geometric perspective and ask the following question: for a given data source, what is the optimal regularizer induced by a convex body? To answer this, a variational optimization problem over the space of convex bodies is proposed to search for the optimal regularizer. We analyze the structure of population risk minimizers by connecting minimization of the population objective to Minkowski’s inequality for convex bodies. These results are also shown to be robust, as we establish convergence of empirical risk minimizers to the population risk minimizer in the limit of infinite data. Based on this characterization of optimal convex regularizers, we then consider whether convexity is the right structure for certain distributions and use our theory to characterize when convex or nonconvex structure should be preferred.

However, federated networks introduce a number of challenges beyond traditional distributed learning scenarios. In addition to being accurate, federated methods must scale to potentially massive and heterogeneous networks of devices, and must exhibit trustworthy behavior—addressing pragmatic concerns related to issues such as fairness, robustness, and user privacy. In this talk, I talk about how heterogeneity lies at the center of the constraints of federated learning—not only affecting the accuracy of the models, but also competing with other critical metrics such as fairness, robustness, and privacy. To address these metrics, I talk about new, scalable federated learning objectives and algorithms that rigorously account for and address sources of heterogeneity. Although our work is grounded by the application of federated learning, I show that many of the techniques and fundamental tradeoffs extend well beyond this use-case.

Talk Title: Modeling Ideological Language with Graph Neural Networks and Structured Sparsity Talk Abstract: The increasing polarization of online political discourse calls for computational tools that automatically detect and monitor ideological divides in social media. While many methods to track ideological polarization have been proposed, most of them rely on knowing in advance the political orientation of text, a requirement seldom met in practice. In this talk, I will discuss research recently published at NAACL and ICML that fully dispenses with the need for labeled data and instead leverages the ubiquitous network structure of online discussion forums, specifically Reddit, to detect ideological polarization. I will first give an overview of prior research on polarization in natural language processing, highlighting salience and framing as two key mechanisms by which ideology manifests itself in language. I will then present Slap4slip, a method that combines graph neural networks with structured sparsity learning to determine the polarization of political issues (e.g., abortion) along the dimensions of salience and framing.",71397f4b2fc838890606367201853850595db6ae548b7376d19a67a206846ef4

Inequality at the social level is harmful to the population as a whole. Thus, a focus on the factors related to health outside the hospital is imperative to not only address specific challenges for high-risk individuals but also to determine what policies will benefit the community as a whole.

I will focus on machine learning systems using person-generated data and in-hospital data from multiple geographical locations worldwide. Next, I will present a causal remedial approach to health inequity using algorithmic fairness that reduces health disparities.

The model includes three main parts: (1) a generator that learns to adapt a sequence of known manipulation activities to resemble patterns of a normal (benign) trading agent while preserving the manipulation intent; (2) a discriminator that differentiates the adversarially adapted manipulation actions from normal trading activities; and (3) an agent-based model that provides feedback in regard to the manipulation effectiveness and profitability of adapted outputs. We conduct experiments on simulated trading actions associated with a manipulator and a benign agent respectively.",e7c463c9ec32cc31a4b268c9799b46d2e57d1c760549e2407065f828fb429f4b

Talk Title : Universality of regularized regression estimators in high dimensions Talk Abstract : The Convex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) has emerged as a prominent theoretical tool for analyzing the precise stochastic behavior of various statistical estimators in the so-called high dimensional proportional regime, where the sample size and the signal dimension are of the same order. However, a well recognized limitation of the existing CGMT machinery rests in its stringent requirement on the exact Gaussianity of the design matrix, therefore rendering the obtained precise high dimensional asymptotics largely a specific Gaussian theory in various important statistical models. This work provides a structural universality framework for a broad class of regularized regression estimators that is particularly compatible with the CGMT machinery.",b765d0881a10565684bdd3e44966cf7745715454241941594b63770bbda9a592

As a proof of concept, we demonstrate our new universality framework in three key examples of regularized regression estimators: the Ridge, Lasso and regularized robust regression estimators, where new universality properties of risk asymptotics and/or distributions of regression estimators and other related quantities are proved. As a major statistical implication of the Lasso universality results, we validate inference procedures using the degrees-of-freedom adjusted debiased Lasso under general design and error distributions. We also provide a counterexample, showing that universality properties for regularized regression estimators do not extend to general isotropic designs.

However, it is not clear if similar tools can be applied to trained neural network where the parameters are no longer i.i.d. due to gradient-based learning. In this work we use RMT to precisely quantify the benefit of feature learning in the “early phase” of gradient descent training. We study the first gradient step under the MSE loss on the first-layer weights W in a two-layer neural network. In the proportional asymptotic limit and an idealized student-teacher setting, we show that the gradient update contains a rank-1 “spike”, which results in an alignment between the weights and the linear component of the teacher model f*. To understand the impact of this alignment, we compute the asymptotic prediction risk of ridge regression on the conjugate kernel after one feature learning step with learning rate \eta. We consider two scalings of \eta. For small \eta, we establish a Gaussian equivalence property for the trained features, and prove that the learned kernel improves upon the initial random features, but cannot defeat the best linear model. Whereas for sufficiently large \eta, we prove that for certain f*, the same ridge estimator goes beyond this “linear regime” and outperforms a wide range of (fixed) kernels.",cb0d4cc9edbaea7088aca937f3432e34365ec1441d6add87c5209771828c6992

We provided a minimax lower bound for this problem and discovered that the variance in DRM leads sample complexity being suboptimal. Based on this observation, we proposed a modification of DRM with optimal sample complexity. Then I’ll introduce the optimization property of a class of Sobolev norms as the objective function.",3abd33816c9674aa41ec5a566fa1030649cddd2910ad92cc945272a064adb1cc

Combining the information from the two papers, we can conclude that DRM is fast for the high dimensional smoothing function due to the low computational cost of each iteration. But for low dimensional rough functions, we should use PINN. In the second part of my talk, I’ll talk about the statistical limit of learning linear operator learning, where both the input and output space are infinite-dimensional. We showed that proper bias and variance trade-offs could lead to optimal learning rates. The optimal learning rate is different from learning finite-dimensional linear operators. We also illustrate how this theory can inspire a multilevel machine learning algorithm. Our theory has wide application in learning differential operators and generative modeling.

We propose a finite-sample p-value that controls the selective Type I error for a test of the difference in means between a pair of clusters obtained using k-means clustering, and show that it can be efficiently computed.

Here, we propose to apply a statistical tool, model criticism in latent space, to evaluate the high-level structure of the generated text. Model criticism compares the distributions between real and generated data in a latent space obtained according to an assumptive generative process. Different generative processes identify specific failure modes of the underlying model. We perform experiments on three representative aspects of high-level discourse—coherence, coreference, and topicality—and find that transformer-based language models are able to capture topical structures but have a harder time maintaining structural coherence or modeling coreference structures.

In this paper, we introduce a methodology for derandomizing model-X knockoffs with provable FDR control. The key insight of our proposed method lies in the discovery that the knockoffs procedure is in essence an e-BH procedure. We make use of this connection, and derandomize model-X knockoffs by aggregating the e-values resulting from multiple knockoff realizations. We prove that the derandomized procedure controls the FDR at the desired level, without any additional conditions (in contrast, previously proposed methods for derandomization are not able to guarantee FDR control). The proposed method is evaluated with numerical experiments, where we find that the derandomized procedure achieves comparable power and dramatically decreased selection variability when compared with model-X knockoffs.

In this talk, I will present FrugalML, a principled framework that jointly learns the strength and weakness of each API on different data, and performs an efficient optimization to automatically identify the best sequential strategy to adaptively use the available APIs within a budget constraint. Our theoretical analysis shows that natural sparsity in the formulation can be leveraged to make FrugalML efficient. We conduct systematic experiments using ML APIs from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Baidu and other providers for tasks including facial emotion recognition, sentiment analysis and speech recognition. Across various tasks, FrugalML can achieve up to 90% cost reduction while matching the accuracy of the best single API, or up to 5% better accuracy while matching the best API’s cost.

Talk Title: Crypt$\epsilon$: Crypto-Assisted Differential Privacy on Untrusted Servers Talk Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is currently the de-facto standard for achieving privacy in data analysis, which is typically implemented either in the ”central” or ”local” model. The local model has been more popular for commercial deployments as it does not require a trusted data collector. This increased privacy, however, comes at the cost of utility and algorithmic expressibility as compared to the central model. In this talk, I will be presenting Crypt$\epsilon$, a system and programming framework that (1) achieves the accuracy guarantees and algorithmic expressibility of the central model (2) without any trusted data collector like in the local model. Crypt$\epsilon$ achieves the ”best of both worlds” by employing two non-colluding untrusted servers that run DP programs on encrypted data from the data owners. In theory, straightforward implementations of DP programs using off-the-shelf secure multi-party computation tools can achieve the above goal. However, in practice, they are beset with many challenges like poor performance and tricky security proofs.",1a0195925db5406e5047cfa8a6e390353f95a1d91c30ba2fdced6f5966a5cb5a

These protocols ensure that the untrusted servers learn nothing more than the noisy outputs, thereby guaranteeing DP for all Crypt$\epsilon$ programs. Crypt$\epsilon$ supports a rich class of DP programs that can be expressed via a small set of transformation and measurement operators followed by arbitrary post-processing. Further, I will talk about a novel performance optimization that leverages the fact that the output is noisy. Consequently, Crypt$\epsilon$ achieves performance that is practical for real-world usage.

This problem arises in applications like X-ray crystallography, where it is infeasible to acquire the phase of the measurements. In this talk, I will describe some results regarding the analysis of this problem in the high-dimensional asymptotic regime where the number of measurements and the signal dimension diverge proportionally so that their ratio remains fixed. The measurement mechanism in phase retrieval is specified by a sensing matrix. A limitation of existing high-dimensional analysis of this problem is that they model this matrix as a random matrix with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian entries. In practice, this matrix is highly structured with limited randomness. I will describe a correction to the i.i.d. sensing model, known as the sub-sampled Haar sensing model, which faithfully captures a crucial orthogonality property of realistic sensing matrices. For the Haar sensing model, I will present a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of commonly used spectral estimators for solving the phase retrieval problem. This characterization can be leveraged to tune certain parameters involved in the spectral estimator optimally. The resulting estimator is information-theoretically optimal. Next, I will describe an empirical universality phenomenon: the performance curves derived for the Haar model accurately describe the observed performance curves for realistic sensing matrices.",589d1da58bee1fbb55445c4a71bbf6b50780e2a2da3724c7b8ff120c597ab8fc

In this work, we develop state-of-the-art NLP models grounded in frameworks from social psychology in order to analyze two social media movements: online media coverage of the #MeToo movement in 2017-2018 and tweets about #BlackLivesMatter protests in 2020. In the first part, we show that despite common perception of the #MeToo movement as empowering, media coverage of events often portrayed women as sympathetic but unpowerful. In the second, we show that positive emotions like hope and optimism are prevalent in tweets with pro-BlackLivesMatter hashtags and significantly correlated with the presence of on-the-ground protests, whereas anger and disgust are not. These results contrast stereotypical portrayals of protesters as perpetuating anger and outrage. Overall, our work provides insight into social movements and debunks harmful stereotypes.

Talk Title: Malicious Attacks against Deep Reinforcement Learning Interpretations Talk Abstract: The past years have witnessed the rapid development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which incorporates deep learning into the solution and makes decisions from unstructured input data without manual engineering of the state space. However, the adoption of deep neural networks makes the decision-making process of DRL opaque and lacking transparency. Motivated by this, various interpretation methods for DRL have been proposed. Those interpretation methods make an implicit assumption that they are performed in a reliable and secure environment. However, given their data-driven nature, these DRL interpretation methods themselves are potentially susceptible to malicious manipulations. In spite of the prevalence of malicious attacks, there is no existing work studying the possibility and feasibility of malicious attacks against DRL interpretations.",c4f99bd14b6908b2238899196c49550ecc9e58951bfa492dc90a6bdd40b7e109

Hence, we design novel algorithms for the realizable setting that are nearly minimax optimal, computationally efficient, and general-purpose, accommodating a wide variety of function classes including kernel methods, Holder smooth functions, and convex functions. The sample complexities of our algorithms can be quantified in terms of well-known quantities like the extended teaching dimension and haystack dimension. However, unlike algorithms based directly on those combinatorial quantities, our algorithms are computationally efficient. To achieve computational efficiency, our algorithms sample from the version space using Monte Carlo “hit-and-run” algorithms instead of maintaining the version space explicitly. Our approach has two key strengths. First, it is simple, consisting of two unifying, greedy algorithms. Second, our algorithms have the capability to seamlessly leverage prior knowledge that is often available and useful in practice.",513481dafcb7d51c1d479cc9f026c93db0f75fd461c105f92b51300175eadcb6

The ability to model heterogeneity in treatment effects of services provides the potential for “precision public health” where allocation of services is based on data-driven predictions of which service will lead to better outcomes. I discuss the scarce resource allocation problem as it applies to homeless service delivery, and the ability to improve upon the current allocation system using algorithmic techniques.

For example, the common practice of examining the empirical distribution of estimated propensity scores is heavily dependent on model specification and has poor uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we propose a formal statistical framework for assessing the extrema of the population propensity score; e.g., the propensity score lies in [0.1, 0.9] almost surely. We develop a family of upper confidence bounds, which we term O-values, for this quantity. We show these bounds are valid in finite samples so long as the observations are independent and identically distributed, without requiring any further modeling assumptions on the data generating process.",246e794641e2182e92d9b0f30f9e95c43d2feb484b038da1ba17c75c9ad87521

In this talk, I will introduce a theoretical framework to study how a decision-maker concerned with both merit and diversity, selects candidate students under imperfect information, limited capacity, and legal constraints. Motivated by recent decisions to drop standardized testing in admissions, we apply this framework to study how information differences lead to disparities across equally skilled groups and quantify the trade-off between information and access in test-free and test-based policies with and without affirmative action. Using application and transcript data from the University of Texas at Austin, we illustrate that there exist practical settings where dropping standardized testing improves or worsens both merit and diversity. Furthermore, we extend this model to demonstrate how privilege differences lead to intra-group disparities and establish that the direction of discrimination at the observable level may differ from the unobservable level. We compare common policies used in practice and take an optimization approach to design an optimal policy under legal constraints.

Talk Title: Adapting to failure of the IID assumption for sequential prediction Talk Abstract: We consider sequential prediction with expert advice when data are generated from distributions varying arbitrarily within an unknown constraint set. We quantify relaxations of the classical IID assumption in terms of these constraint sets, with IID sequences at one extreme and adversarial mechanisms at the other. The Hedge algorithm, long known to be minimax optimal in the adversarial regime, was recently shown to be minimax optimal for IID data. We show that Hedge with deterministic learning rates is suboptimal between these extremes, and present new algorithms that adaptively achieve the minimax optimal rate of regret with respect to our relaxations of the IID assumption, and do so without knowledge of the underlying constraint set. We analyze our algorithm using the follow-the-regularized-leader framework, and prove it corresponds to Hedge with adaptive learning rates.

Incorporating geometry and physics priors, the trained deep networks show more robust generalization across patients and better interpretability. Second, motivated by the unique characteristics of medical images that patients are often scanned serially over time during clinical treatment, where earlier images provide abundant prior knowledge of the patient’s anatomy, I proposed a prior embedding method to encode internal information of image priors through coordinate-based neural representation learning. Since this method requires no training data from external subjects, it relaxes the burden of data collection, and can be easily generalized across different imaging modalities and anatomies. Following this, I developed a novel algorithm of temporal neural representation learning for longitudinal study. Combining both physics priors and image priors, I showed proposed algorithm can successfully capture subtle yet significant structure changes such as tumor progression in sparse-sampling image reconstruction, which can be applied to tackle real-world challenges in cancer patients treatment and radiation therapy.

Talk Title: AI for Science: Learning from Experts and Data Talk Abstract: In many fields, the amount of recorded scientific data is increasing much faster than the speed at which researchers can analyze and interpret them. For example, recorded videos of animal behavior over a few days can take domain experts months to analyze. Innovations in data science, such as machine learning, provide a promising direction to enable scientists to scalably perform data-driven experiments.

To address these challenges, my current work has focused on incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning to reduce human effort for data analysis. I will discuss methods to improve the sample-efficiency and interpretability of models in the context of behavior modeling. To learn annotation-sample efficient representations, we developed a framework to unify self-supervision with weak programmatic supervision from domain experts.",1954b8328eda5fe0dfceacfedbee98665c2c2634fd4354293825ebdc45930c7e

Studies in bibliometrics have indicated that entity resolution changes network properties in citation networks, but little research has used real-world social networks that vary in size and type. We present a novel perspective on entity resolution in networks—where we propagate error from the entity resolution process into downstream network inferences. We also seek to understand how match thresholds in unsupervised entity resolution affect both global and local network properties, such as the degree distribution, centrality, transitivity, and motifs such as stars and triangles. We propose a calibration of these network metrics given measures of entity resolution quality, such as node “splitting” and “lumping” errors.

Talk Title: Modeling the Impact of Social Determinants of Health on Covid-19 Transmission and Mortality to Understand Health Inequities Watch Abby’s Spotlight Research Talk Talk Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted drastic health inequities, particularly in cities such as Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, and New York City. Reducing Covid-19 morbidity and mortality will likely require an increased focus on social determinants of health, given their disproportionate impact on populations most heavily affected by Covid-19. A better understanding of how factors such as household income, housing location, health care access, and incarceration contribute to Covid-19 transmission and mortality is needed to inform policies around social distancing and testing and vaccination scale-up. This work builds upon an existing agent-based model of Covid-19 transmission in Chicago, CityCOVID. CityCOVID consists of a synthetic population that is statistically representative of Chicago’s population (2.7 million persons), along with their associated places (1.4 million places) and behaviors (13,000 activity schedules).",f5358eee203b9824ed240eb151d76b51f3cb3d9d61afbd1fa3de58421dc39569

Covid-19 transmission is determined via a simulated epidemiological model based on this generated contact network by tuning (fitting) model parameters that result in simulation output that matches observed Covid-19 death and hospitalization data from the City of Chicago. Using the CityCOVID infrastructure, we quantify the impact of social determinants of health on Covid-19 transmission dynamics by applying statistical techniques to empirical data to study the relationship between social determinants of health and Covid-19 outcomes.

CNNs are the first widespread example of a symmetry, in this case the translational symmetry of images, being used to advise much more efficient and transparent network architectures. More recently, CNNs were generalized to other non-commutative symmetry groups such as SO(3). However, in physics application one is more likely to encounter input data that belong to linear representations of Lie Groups, as opposed to being functions (or “images”) on a symmetric space of the group. To deal with such problems, I will present a general feed-forward architecture that takes vectors as inputs, works entirely in the Fourier space of the symmetry group, and is fully covariant. This approach allows one to achieve equal performance with drastically fewer learnable parameters, Moreover, the models become much more physically meaningful and more likely to be interpretable. My application of choice is in particle physics, where the main symmetry is the 6-dimensional Lorentz group. I will demonstrate the success of covariant architectures compared to more conventional approaches.

Since policy value and regret may not be point-identifiable, we study a method that minimizes the worst-case estimated regret over an uncertainty set for propensity weights that controls the extent of unobserved confounding. We prove generalization guarantees that ensure our policy will be safe when applied in practice and will in fact obtain the best-possible uniform control on the range of all possible population regrets that agree with the possible extent of confounding. Finally, we assess and compare our methods on synthetic and semi-synthetic data. In particular, we consider a case study on personalizing hormone replacement therapy based on the parallel WHI observational study and clinical trial.",1d8ad18311415f8a7e4dbf994cd2490d92608494037211c389f8347e7a053f81

To overcome these limitations, we first propose to benchmark membership inference privacy risks by improving existing non-neural network based inference attacks and proposing a new inference attack method based on a modification of prediction entropy. Using our benchmark attacks, we demonstrate that existing membership inference defense approaches are not as effective as previously reported. Next, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained privacy analysis by formulating and deriving a new metric called the privacy risk score. Our privacy risk score metric measures an individual sample’s likelihood of being a training member, which allows an adversary to perform membership inference attacks with high confidence. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the privacy risk score metric and demonstrate the distribution of privacy risk scores across individual samples is heterogeneous. Our work emphasizes the importance of a systematic and rigorous evaluation of privacy risks of machine learning models.

Talk Title: Reasoning about Social Dynamics and Social Bias in Language Watch Maarten’s Spotlight Research Talk Talk Abstract: Humans easily make inferences to reason about the social and power dynamics of situations (e.g., stories about everyday interactions), but such reasoning is still a challenge for modern NLP systems. In this talk, I will address how we can make machines reason about social commonsense and social biases in text, and how this reasoning could be applied in downstream applications. In the first part, I will discuss PowerTransformer, our new unsupervised model for controllable debiasing of text through the lens of connotation frames of power and agency. Trained using a combined reconstruction and paraphrasing objective, this model can rewrite story sentences such that its characters are portrayed with more agency and decisiveness. After establishing its performance through automatic and human evaluations, we show how PowerTransformer can be used to mitigate gender bias in portrayals of movie characters.",61721bbb6a87dff14bfa742e5d3f077f0c9f2c4d3c6b00d490f8ad233cabfb97

Talk Title: Formal Logic Enhanced Deep Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems Watch Meiyi’s Research Lightning Talk Talk Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are broadly applied and have outstanding achievements for prediction and decision-making support for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). However, for large-scale and complex integrated CPS with high uncertainties, DNN models are not always robust, often subject to anomalies, and subject to erroneous predictions, especially when the predictions are projected into the future (uncertainty and errors grow over time).",a966790af1c56bc907964d5dcfc854100f9f7a7f0bbd5bef8cacd5439f4b5c32

Talk Title: Human-AI Collaborative Decision Making on Rehabilitation Assessment Talk Abstract: Rehabilitation monitoring systems with sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) provide an opportunity to improve current rehabilitation practices by automatically collecting quantitative data on patient’s status. However, the adoption of these systems still remains a challenge. This paper presents an interactive AI-based system that supports collaborative decision making with therapists for rehabilitation assessment. This system automatically identifies salient features of assessment to generate patient-specific analysis for therapists, and tunes with their feedback. In two evaluations with therapists, we found that our system supports therapists significantly higher agreement on assessment (0.71 average F1-score) than a traditional system without analysis (0.66 average F1-score, p < 0.05). In addition, after tuning with therapist’s feedback, our system significantly improves its performance (from 0.8377 to 0.9116 average F1-scores, p < 0.01).",6d4d79f58f056e9fee4b830fe239c06d5ec3f203469e19810dca26fa61b2ce1e

Recently, neuroimaging studies, for example, using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) have been gaining popularity for studying brain dysfunction.

Talk Title: Power Outage Risk Interconnection: Relationship with Social and Environmental Critical Risk Indicators Watch Olukunle’s Research Lightning Talk Talk Abstract: The interconnections between diverse components in a system can provide profound insights on the health and risk states of the system as a whole. Highly interconnected systems tend to accumulate risks until a large, systemic crisis hits. For example, in the 2007-09 financial crisis, the interconnection of financial institutions heightened near the collapse, suggesting the system could no longer absorb risks. Extending concepts of interconnectedness and systemic risk to coupled human-natural systems, one might expect similar behaviours of risk accumulation and heightened connectivity, leading to potential system failures. The Predictive Risk Investigation System (PRISM) for Multi-layer Dynamic Interconnection Analysis aims to explore the complex interconnectedness and systemic risks in human-natural systems. Applying the PRISM approach, we could uncover dynamic relationships and trends in climate resilience and preparedness using Energy, Environmental and Social indicators. This study proposes a case-study application of the PRISM approach to the State of Massachusetts using a dataset of over 130000 power outages in the state from 2013-2018.",96a042c0b3eac33b2b641ed0206fd317cc60b1748c8fdcdf83e1fa7122aa008d

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become a part of routine clinical assessment for screening of high-risk patients for breast cancer and monitoring therapy response because it has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy. Current CADx methods for breast lesion assessment on MRI, however, are mostly focused on one sequence, the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Therefore, we investigated methods for incorporating three sequences in mpMRI to improve the CADx performance in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions. We compared integrating the mpMRI information at the image level, feature level, or classifier output level. In addition, transfer learning is often employed in deep learning applications in medical imaging due to data scarcity. However, pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in transfer learning require two-dimensional (2D) inputs, limiting the ability to utilize high-dimensional information in medical imaging.

Biodiversity data is correlated in time and space, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to new sensor deployments.

By combining various large-scale datasets and interdisciplinary analytical frameworks rooted in data mining, statistical physics, and computational social science, we discover a series of fundamental mechanisms and signals underlying the processes in which (1) individuals and organizations build on previous repeated failures towards ultimate victory or defeat in science, startups and security; (2) scientific elites produce breakthrough discoveries in their scientific careers; and (3) scientific research gets funded and used by the general public.",5c762416a48bd80c9c274f7f5ade3c51387cb1b562392e50ef2e60a08cb8147d

By doing so, we are expected to ground the prior knowledge of machines to human knowledge first and perform explicit reasoning for various downstream tasks for better interpretable machine learning. In this talk, I will briefly present two pieces of my existing work that leverage human expert and commonsense knowledge reasoning to increase the interpretability and transparency of machine learning models in the field of natural language processing. Firstly, I will show how existing cognitive theories on human memory can inspire an interpretable framework for rationalizing the medical relation prediction task based on expert knowledge. Secondly, I will introduce how we can learn better word representations based on commonsense knowledge and reasoning. Our proposed framework learns a commonsense reasoning module guided by a self-supervision task and provides word pair and single word representations distilled from learned reasoning modules. Both the above works are able to offer reasoning paths to justify their decisions and boost the model interpretability that humans can understand with minimal knowledge barriers.

As public health measures forced many people to work from home or attend remote school, the critical importance of internet connectivity became evident, as reflected in stories of children doing schoolwork in parked cars in search of wireless internet. In a new project funded by a $1.2 million grant from data.org , University of Chicago Computer Science Professor Nick Feamster will lead a team of UChicago researchers pinpointing gaps in digital infrastructure, from the lack of cable or fiber connectivity to a spotty video streaming session. The effort will also build a toolkit to help civic organizations — cities, government agencies, community-based organizations and others — make informed decisions about improvements to effectively narrow the digital divide. The project will start with focused efforts in several Chicago communities, creating a framework and template that can eventually be scaled across the entire city and replicated in other cities and communities. “Closing the digital divide is the ‘moonshot’ challenge for our generation,” said Feamster, Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and faculty director of the Center for Data and Computing . “It is a grand-scale challenge that will require not only technical expertise, but also an integrative approach to both scholarship and societal impact.",ff5a27d9c1b08a5bc1c19ca23885d5f34509715fb0fbed967b4bae943e12db0e

Feamster’s work on these problems dates back a decade, when he helped the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) design the tests and analysis for the first of its annual Measuring Broadband America reports in 2010. And yet, despite more than a decade of attention to this problem, the challenges persist. One of the biggest problems, as acknowledged by technologists and policymakers alike, is bad data. For example, the FCC broadband map , the most commonly-used resource, only reports access at the census block level, overestimating the number of homes with high speed internet. Additionally, some popular internet speed tests were designed for earlier, bygone eras when access speeds were much slower, before modern technologies such as video streaming or conferencing and households with many connected devices. Download speed is also no longer the only metric that matters. Current datasets lack important factors such as the cost or subscription rate of area internet service, its performance when multiple devices are online simultaneously, and the quality of experience while using apps such as YouTube or Zoom. Many of these tests are also deployed by biased population samples.",f92fb93731f842d321ffde472b0577b95833068630253f79b7e857770775eb01

The challenge is how to represent that information both concisely and intuitively for consumers, regulators, Internet service providers and really anyone who wants to know if the Internet is performing in a way that provides a good quality of experience for its users.” A Scale-Up Toolkit for Closing the Divide The data.org project takes a new approach to this problem, recognizing that solving this problem requires a combination of technical, policy, social, and economic data about the nature of gaps in internet connectivity. Gathering this data will first require “starting small” in individual communities and refining the empirical methods, analysis, inference, and decision-making tools for stakeholders before attempting to scale them broadly.

Over the course of the eight weeks, Zamudio created a process for matching speed test results with the geospatial data of the tests and helped match the results to specific internet service providers (ISPs), allowing for the data collected by IEI to be submitted to the federal government for inclusion in their broadband mapping project. In particular, she identified community anchor institutions, an important class of broadband serviceable locations that were left off of the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s Broadband Map. This work resulted in a list of places to engage, including a specific request from the state library of Illinois: to direct libraries to participate in the BEAD challenge process. Using the DSI BEAD challenge , users like local libraries could test their internet connection speeds with the simple click of a button. The user then had the option to submit these results, along with information about their geographic location and ISP, to IEI for analysis and reporting back to the state broadband office.

Schmit encapsulated the larger vision, saying, “Through record federal and state investments, Illinois has embarked on historic expansion of broadband infrastructure across the state. To meet our goal of making sure every Illinoisan can participate in the digital world, we also need to address non-infrastructure barriers that stand in the way of connectivity – from internet affordability to access to connected devices to basic computing skills.” Throughout the summit, the resounding message was clear: partnerships are essential to acceler",d63f078d50a8495d027cf40d8c3b07339f742c30f6315eaa742403beda41ce58

Gil Quiniones , the CEO of ComEd, emphasized this point. He noted that finding a solution to the digital divide is a multifaceted and complex endeavor. The digital divide is a multifaceted challenge, and resolving it requires diverse partnerships and durable coalitions. Service providers, educational institutions, policymakers, and the community must unite to ensure that the benefits of the digital age are accessible to all. Quiniones acknowledged that the cost of providing access, both for service providers and customers, could be significant. However, through partnerships and collaborative efforts, these costs can be mitigated. The summit demonstrated that there is widespread recognition for the need to achieve digital equity in every community. The Digital Inclusion Summit served as a testament to what can be achieved when individuals and organizations come together with a shared mission. It was not merely a conversation about the digital divide; it was a call to action, a blueprint for a future where digital inclusion is not just an aspiration but a reality. IEI’s Digital Inclusion Summit was more than just a gathering of like-minded individuals; it was a catalyst for change. By addressing the multifaceted challenges of digital exclusion, exploring strategies to bridge the divide, and sharing success stories from Chicago and beyond, the summit set the stage for a future where digital equity is not a dream, but a reality.",20dd2eb15dd4e33344741d18907f9c67f3609b02833e21f1ecf0dc78b4e9688d

The DSI Internet Equity Initiative produces data, tools, and research to study internet connectivity at the local scale, generating insights that can help guide these investments. In late December, Internet Equity Initiative co-PI Nicole Marwell , Associate Professor at the Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, joined WTTW’s Chicago Tonight news program to discuss the Illinois broadband funding, the areas most in need, and what steps should be taken beyond just increasing access to high-speed networks. “What we have to also remember is that it’s not just lack of infrastructure that leads to a household being disconnected,” Marwell said. “In the city of Chicago, where we have close to 200,000 households that still are not connected to internet, that’s not because they don’t have the infrastructure, it’s usually because they can’t afford the high price of a broadband plan, or because they are lacking in digital literacy…those issues of digital inclusion and affordability are the ones that we see as much more important in an urban area.” You can view the full segment below, and learn more about the Internet Equity Initiative at their data portal .",c52c664b801ca181778328b34e5d1491bd9f2f7d6c42dccb937417d7d03563c4

In Chicago alone, more than 100,000 children lacked the high-speed internet access needed to attend virtual classes. Inequity in people’s ability to access and afford the internet, as well as use it safely and productively, creates a digital divide. To narrow the gap, researchers must first truly and deeply understand it. During the pandemic Nicole Marwell , AM’94, PhD’00, associate professor in the Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, became increasingly concerned about the plight of Chicagoans without web access, particularly students. “Kids in this country have a right to a public education,” she says. “If they can’t get it because they don’t have an internet connection, we are violating one of their most basic rights.” Marwell’s expertise is in urban governance—“how things get done in cities and why”—and she felt compelled to address digital inequity. But she was unfamiliar with the technical aspects of the problem. For Nick Feamster , the reverse was true. Over the past two decades, the Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and director of research for UChicago’s Data Science Institute has focused almost exclusively on measuring computer network performance. When he joined UChicago in July 2019, Feamster was at an inflection point in his career, he says, wanting to apply his skills toward a broader social impact.",24589dfce3e9360ca5b5829fa7ea2a342681f57c27cdfc3b167c0b16b3b5b588

When Marwell and Feamster met, they immediately recognized that each held a piece of the puzzle. “We realized,” says Feamster, “that this is a problem that couldn’t be solved with either one of us in isolation.” In the summer of 2020, Marwell and Feamster began working together on the Internet Equity Initiative , which brings together experts and scholars in computer science, social science, data science, and public policy. The project, which has now become one of the Data Science Institute’s flagship research initiatives, uses existing data to explore the digital divide and develops new ways of measuring internet activity to help answer the questions yet to be asked. Analyzing data gathered from 20 cities around the country—consolidated in a freely accessible data portal hosted by the initiative—the team began to dig deeper into internet inequity, with a particular interest in Chicago. Researchers determined that about 80 percent of households in the city are connected to the internet. But when they looked at Chicago’s 77 communities separately, they found notable disparities.

This summer, high school students Ranya Sharma and Jaleel Drones-Akins exemplify those efforts by participating in the DSI Summer Lab, their second time in a DSI program. Sharma, a recent graduate of Barrington High School in suburban Chicago and incoming freshman at UChicago, is in her second year of Summer Lab, conducting research with the Internet Equity Initiative and DSI faculty director of research Nick Feamster . Drones-Akins, a senior at Kenwood Academy, joined Summer Lab after completing the first edition of the Data4All Workshop in 2021, and works on a project team from the social impact track overseen by DSI data scientist Daniel Grzenda. Both students said that Summer Lab has given them valuable research experience and improved their data science skills. “I always knew that I wanted to study computer science, since the end of my sophomore year of high school,” Sharma said. “But I never really had experience in it, except for in a classroom setting. So I wanted to fully dive in deep as to what people do in computer science beyond basic coding classes.” “It has advanced my interest in data science and computer science in general,” said Drones-Akins. “I came into the program, and I thought I knew so much.",4df4af18500fb27a562b63d778aeec23dc4c94ec31a41944cee2fbdadc6f2767

With faculty, students, and researchers from UChicago, Argonne, and Fermilab, the students applied their new knowledge in group projects using real COVID-19 data, studying the effects of the pandemic across Chicago neighborhoods and demographic groups. Drones-Akins credits the workshop with introducing him to using the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks, skills that he uses frequently in Summer Lab. This summer, he’s part of a team working with partner organization and 11th Hour Project grantee Remora Fishing Traceability on their “Smart Scale” technology that uses computer vision and deep learning to estimate the weight of fish caught at small fisheries. “Having the knowledge of how to work with those tools definitely prepared me for the project that I’m working on,” Drones-Akins said. “I’m actually able to do research now, whereas Data4All felt like a prep for this summer – it was a really good prep, because it taught me essential skills. Summer Lab is definitely more hands-on with the research, and I love that.” Sharma is spending her second consecutive summer working with Feamster, who studies internet network reliability, security, and privacy.",b2b88948f022747fcde58f9a9878e7fd2ff97dcb54385e2656c973c0212630a6

Mapping state-wide pesticide use data with demographic and geospatial data from the US Census Bureau, the Pesticides Explorer enables users to quantify and chart the effects of pesticide use in California with easily digestible, interactive visualizations. “This tool opens up California’s extensive data on pesticide use so everyone who is interested—everyday Californians, scientists, researchers, and growers—can understand it,” said CPR Development Director Jane Sellen. “With demographic data overlaid with pesticide use data, you can see who is most impacted and in what ways.” Since 1990, the state of California has collected some of the most comprehensive pesticide use data in the world as a part of its Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) program, with data available by crop, geography, application method, and more variables. However, said Susan Paykin , Senior Associate Director of Community-Centered Data Science at the DSI and a lead on the project, “Although this kind of data is publicly available, it’s often unwieldy to use, and not always shown in relation to communities.” Founded in 1996, the CPR coalition has worked to reform local and state pesticide policy to protect human and environmental health.",71ec1f4e87960e0603ec32bd5d90c4af51419fbccf514b2a345bca2dd90d2b91

This year, 202 students applied their data science skills through the Clinic to a broad spectrum of challenges, with projects including using machine learning to reduce the costs of particle physics research at Fermilab and developing models to predict landslides in Rwanda. In the Clinic, students work as teams of data scientists under the guidance of one to two mentors – experts from among our partners and University of Chicago faculty and postdocs – meeting weekly to share progress and troubleshoot challenges. Students also gain experience adapting their approaches and communicating with each other and their clients as they work together to produce deliverables. In addition to providing students with real-world experience, Clinic projects offer a distinct benefit to our partners. According to Assistant Clinic Director Tim Hannifan , “The Clinic provides a valuable opportunity for our partner organizations to test ideas they may lack the resources or capacity to explore in-house, and allows them to work with some of the brightest students, in many cases supplementing their talent pipeline.” This year, Clinic teams completed 28 projects to support clients at home and abroad, including industry partners, UChicago institutions, nonprofit organizations, and international university partners: This spring, the DSI hosted several events to celebrate the accomplishments",aefc21aa3aec51c43e9c1abf0d85c124fad9ca8b3e478601ae2391c75f50100f

As data science and AI’s reach extends to nearly every facet of life, how can the digital native generation marshal its skills to drive social impact? To open this discussion to the community, the Data Science Institute (DSI) and The Patrick J McGovern Foundation (PJMF) co-hosted the event Tech-for-Good Careers: A Community-Centered Approach to Data and AI Innovation . Speaking in a fireside chat about the future of data science and technology with DSI Faculty Co-Director and UChicago Distinguished Service Professor Dan Nicolae, Vilas Dhar, President of The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, inspired responsibility and optimism: “We’re really good at building amazing things,” Dhar said, but these should be informed by “a commitment to a society founded in equity and justice. The conversation about technology begins with what our society should look like.” Dhar emphasized the vital role the rising generation of data scientists will play in the direction AI takes: “Ethical AI [is] fundamentally a human function. We are encoding the values of a moment, embedding them in the tools we’re using to analyze the world around us.” He underscored the central place of academic spaces in both leading the conversations about what the future will look like and actively shaping that future, saying: “These are the rooms where that [building] happens.” The evening’s agenda highlighted ways UChicago faculty, staff, and students are leveraging data science",b1ea4b1565bf273912d3c0595ab6702ff128a98bfc9d877502bd6218a8ec6072

Alumni Paths to Using Tech for Social Impact The program kicked off with a panel where alumni traced their career journeys. Launa Greer (MSCAPP ’21) spoke about her path as a software engineer working for a consulting firm to working in the social impact space: “I was looking for opportunities to blend tech together with service and policy. [While in graduate school] I took a project-based class with the DSI Data Science Clinic , helping a nonprofit track deforestation caused by the palm oil industry, and it was addictive,” she said. Launa now serves as a staff software engineer at the DSI, partnering with social impact organizations through The 11 th Hour Project Software and Data Hub . Alumni paths ventured beyond traditional engineering roles as well: Andrew Fan (BA ’13), explained how journalism at the Invisible Institute, where he serves as Executive Director, grows out of innovative analyses conducted with direction from community voices. Speaking about the genesis of the Invisible Institute’s 2023 investigation “ Missing in Chicago ,” which earned a 2024 Pulitzer Prize in local reporting, Fan said, “We didn’t start out with missing persons. We actually found it through data-based inquiry. We created a system where we were looking at huge troughs of police complaints to identify patterns in police handling, teaming with community volunteers to help us understand.” Kayecee Palisoc (MSCAPP ’24) knew she wanted to apply her skills to structural issues but didn’t know how.",bc37ac8a60d8c5bc26b0d274984cd096b7f2b576f8de0c3d5c516379f2de4245

McGovern Foundation Invite the Next Generation to Imagine Data and AI for Good,news,generic,,2,"As a DSI Community Data Fellow in 2023, Palisoc was able to assist the State of Illinois Commission on Equity and Inclusion’s financial inclusion program. “That was my first exposure to government work,” she said, “and looking back that led me to my current role.” Today, in her work with the City of Chicago’s Department of Technology and Innovation, she serves as a liaison between technical providers and the City. Alums shared advice for students preparing to enter the workforce fulltime, encouraging students to “try to get into the community and work with organizations to discover their needs.” Greer emphasized that “tech is most effective when it’s really rooted in the needs of the community, rather than the flashy new thing.” She further advised students to “own your skills development,” and reminded them to leverage the community they build on campus: “You might be the most technical person in your organization,” she said, “but you have a network that extends beyond it that you can draw on.” Responsible Data Science: What Does It Mean in 2025? Highlighting social impact data and AI case studies, Hazem Mahmoud, Director of Products and Services at PJMF, shared some of the principles the Foundation applies throughout development from ideation to testing, deployment, and maintenance, which included ensuring tools remain people & community-focused, and keeping humans in the loop during production.",6829ab3ba80e131da36d32b9de183614d691cbba2c3650e2c34c38c2d26c601a

Mahmoud emphasized the vital role of data scientists and engineers in 2025: “If you think about tech today, it impacts how we spend our time together, the relationships we have, the values we decide we want to keep as a society, and that’s a huge responsibility.” He encouraged students to meet this challenge proactively by asking questions, educating themselves through coursework in ethics, and advocating in their work to “take the time to contribute to open-source tools that protect users and communities.” Illustrating the Data Science Institute’s own approach to community-centered data science, Dylan Halpern, Full-Stack Software Engineer at DSI and Susan Paykin, Senior Associate Director of Community-Centered Data Science, presented PalmWatch, a recent social impact data science projec t. This project began in 2021 when nonprofit Inclusive Development International connected with the DSI, with support from The 11 th Hour Project, to quantify the impacts of the palm oil industry on deforestation and hold responsible corporations to account. The DSI team developed scripts to clean, extract, and standardize information from public reports to estimate the area affected by individual mills.",c05a37992f13eb2dc607f6b9b59ea9ec7960496e5e65e563c679f7ce9e9731c9

McGovern Foundation Invite the Next Generation to Imagine Data and AI for Good,news,generic,,4,"The team then packaged these findings into PalmWatch, a public web tool where users can not only examine past impact but also estimate future deforestation risk by mill, company, brand, and country. The DSI has since continued its collaboration with IDI and PalmWatch through work with the Data Science Clinic. The concluding poster session and reception showcased student-led work in community-centered data science research and applications. Students didn’t shy away from challenges, mapping access to public libraries with an eye to greater equity, and developing natural language models to enable more efficient and ethical institutional purchasing practices. Another student team trained LLMs to identify problematic loans for BankTrack, an organization that tracks the activity of private banks. One of these students, Jack Sanderson (BS ’27), was inspired to continue exploring the space. He has since focused on AI safety and security and expressed excitement after the event to continue applying frontier technologies to real-world problems. The Path Ahead Community-centered data science is core to the DSI’s mission of research, holistic education, and cross-disciplinary partnerships. Since 2021, the DSI has served as the centralized hub for data science and software for the 11th Hour Project, a program of the Schmidt Family Foundation, which supports nonprofits across its programs in energy, food and agriculture, human rights, indigenous communities, and marine technology.",cdf73774f7a77c7a198eeb664db46b1f11ba00cedb484c12a31c3a9cd211b0e1

The dataset identifies 279 large-scale tree and crop-planting carbon credit projects that corporations have initiated across the world since 2016. GRAIN released the dataset with an accompanying report that highlights the social and environmental impacts of these ‘land deal’ projects. GRAIN is an international non-profit organization that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. As part of their research and advocacy efforts, GRAIN tracks information about land deals for carbon farming to encourage oversight and monitor their impacts to local communities’ sovereignty. GRAIN’s goal was to collect and expand the information in leading carbon credit databases and combine them with important details from identified articles of interest. This allowed for the creation of a dataset of carbon farming land acquisition deals across the globe. The DSI brought technical expertise in working with complex data sources, building automated pipelines, as well as visualizing and communicating that data to make this project possible. Carbon credits or carbon offsets are generated by projects designed to either reduce emissions or capture and store carbon.",b6bd7ba42f2b73aa918ae26abfadc9aae52fc61a3afff9d70a8e27b37dcfad2f

In its most basic form, a company buys land, plants trees, and gets a certification company to provide them a number of carbon credits equivalent to the number of tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent their action reduced or removed from the environment. These carbon credits can then be sold to companies that are interested in advertising better net emissions. Working with GRAIN’s staff, DSI software engineer Trevor Spreadbury parsed available information to build the dataset of carbon farming projects that met the following criteria: projects that involve the large-scale planting of crops and/or tree species on a combined area of land over 100 hectares for the purpose of producing carbon credits; are driven by companies from outside the communities; were initiated since 2016 and up to March 31, 2024 (roughly post-Paris Agreement); and are located in the global South. These projects involve over 9 million hectares of land in the global South– an area roughly the size of Portugal. The most affected region, in terms of land area, is Africa, with projects covering over 5.2 million hectares. Using this dataset, GRAIN found that 52 countries in the global South have been targeted by carbon farming projects. Half the projects are in just four countries: China, India, Brazil and Colombia.

They found that as the number of auction houses has decreased, so have prices for poultry. With medium and smaller auction houses closing their doors, large poultry conglomerates have been able to keep prices lower, which benefits these larger corporations over small farm operations.

Sai also completed a comprehensive project for the U.S. based organization Climate Cabinet , creating interactive maps of rural cooperatives, municipal utilities, and public power plants. These maps can be used to identify clean energy projects, promote clean energy initiatives, and facilitate equitable community development. In a similar climate-focused project, Ming-Chieh (Eddie) Liu (MPCS ‘23) collaborated with Greenwave , a global network of regenerative ocean farmers. Greenwave provides direct payments to kelp farmers to foster ocean and climate restoration. Eddie developed a machine-learning model to predict weights of kelp from photos, so that Greenwave can accurately evaluate sustainable kelp production and pay sea farmers for their cultivation. Diamon Dunlap (MSCAPP ‘24) and Qingyi He (MPP ‘23) embarked on an ambitious project with the Chicago Public Library . Using anonymized patron data and census tract maps, Diamon and Qingyi developed an interactive visualization that evaluates library branch utilization and illustrates which of Chicago Public Library’s 81 branches are underutilized by their local communities or are attracting visitors outside of their areas of impact. Diamon also worked on a project for a local Chicago education and youth mentoring organization, PLAN4SUCCESS .",c61060b0067a44ccc5c9944e08c1114b21867a842c5187b4ae43515028319376

The theme for the 2025 Summer Experience was natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLM). Students worked with real data to solve real-world problems in partnership with social impact organizations across the world. Many of these organizational partners come from with The 11th Hour Project, a program of the Schmidt Family Foundation, for which UChicago DSI serves as the centralized software and data science hub . BankTrack is an international tracking, campaigning, and NGO support organization focused on private sector commercial banks and the activities they finance. Many such financial activities are disclosed through Form 8-Ks. A Form 8-K is a report that public companies in the United States file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose material events that may affect their financial health or investor interests. It essentially provides investors with real-time updates on significant developments. They can also be an important source of information to disclose hidden roles investors play in projects that can cause ethical concerns such as environmental or human rights harms. This summer, students worked to support BankTrack by developing a commercial debt tracker that helps advocacy organizations shed light on these financial relationships.",1598620209f139960b35d34a831dce98944c85d8b5008f92d56b51bbd04a44b6

Utilizing a variety of language models, the group assessed each model’s efficiency with summarization, multilingualism, and performance. They were able to successfully obtain summarization outputs from multiple models, including Gemma, Phi-4, and Llama-3. They found that Phi-4 was the best model for the chatbot, as it offered fast and quality responses, was cost effective as an open-source model, and was compatible with hardware limitations. Some future directions of this work include expanding chatbot functionality to more countries, extending support in more languages, and improving the website’s concurrency to handle more users simultaneously. The palm oil industry is tied to land conflicts, labor violations, and environmental harm. There are several online databases of grievances submitted against palm oil producers, yet many community complaints remain scattered and overlooked.

Multiple methods were used to evaluate several topic modeling techniques, including visualizations (word clouds, topic listings, frequency graphs, etc.) and human oversight. Outcomes of initial topic models were tested for sustainability over previously unseen grievances by training a multi-label classifier that is capable of tagging each grievance with multiple topics. In the end, the team demonstrated they were able to create a sustainable and scalable pipeline to interpret palm oil grievances over time. Identifying which candidate is best aligned with an individual’s or organization’s values is key to actually voting in one’s best interest.

To evaluate generalizability of the models, the group trained and tested on data from pairs of states and all states excluding Texas together. Texas data was used as a separate test set that was never utilized for training to get a true estimate of the model’s performance on previously unseen data. The baseline models generally performed well when trained and tested on the same set of states, but failed to generalize, showing signs of overfitting. The deep learning models also generally performed well when trained and tested on the same set of states. However, the models initially struggled to transfer when trained on one pair of states and tested on another. Through model experimentation and fine-tuning, students accurately classified donor names as either individuals or organizations across four states. Future work may focus on multi-class classification, breaking down organizations into subcategories such as committees, companies, parties, and more. Humor is prevalent in online textual content, but it can also serve as a source of trolling and perpetuate discrimination and cyberbullying in digital spaces.

To address this, students worked to build a text classification system that is able to detect the use of stereotypes or biased representations in humorous content extracted from a collection of jokes in English publicly available online. Avery Pratt, Malcolm Felix, Jiaqi (Scarlett) He, Casidhe Pierre, and Dickson Acheampong explored two modeling approaches. Creating a novel annotation framework, students labeled datasets using their customized framework and compared their labeling to that of a finetuned model. The proposed annotation framework utilized two independent annotators for each example and required texts to be labelled across three dimensions: joke type, rhetoric, and target. Mistral and OpenAI were leveraged for few-shot prompting, and a host of pretrained models were finetuned and optimized for performance. In the end the study confirmed that while humor classification is challenging, prompt engineering offered flexibility and speed, especially for prototyping or exploring new joke types. However, fine-tuned models generally perform better on fixed tasks with well-labeled datasets.

These models can reason counterfactually about the effects of different services on each household and resulting predictions can be used for matching households to services. The ability to model heterogeneity in treatment effects of services provides the potential for “precision public health” where allocation of services is based on data-driven predictions of which service will lead to better outcomes. I discuss the scarce resource allocation problem as it applies to homeless service delivery, and the ability to improve upon the current allocation system using algorithmic techniques. I compare prediction algorithms to each other as well as to the ability of the general public to make these decisions. As homeless services are scarce public goods, it is vital to ensure allocations are not only efficient, but fair and ethical. I discuss efforts to ensure fair decisions and to understand how people prioritize households who should receive scarce homeless services. I also discuss future work and next steps as well as policy implications.

This means that the notebooks will often already have functioning code. Depending on the task, students simply need to run a cell of code (Use) or change (Modify) individual elements like variables and parameters of functions and view the output. As the workshop progresses and the students become more familiar with the code, students will be asked to write (Create) more of their code from scratch. This can include pulling code from other notebooks. Interspersed through the notebooks are “Journal” prompts where students are asked to check understanding, reflect and predict.

Throughout the week, the students applied their new knowledge in group projects using real COVID-19 data, studying the effects of the pandemic across Chicago neighborhoods and demographic groups. “The main goal of the Data4All workshop was to get the students hooked on data science, and then show them a plethora of pathways through which they can pursue it further, because there really is no one way to go into data science,” said Katherine Rosengarten, administrative specialist for the Center for Data and Computing and co-organizer of the workshop. “We also want to encourage the students’ own interests and ways of thinking critically about data and data science, because we think that the field of data science needs these voices and new perspectives, especially from folks that are historically underrepresented. Students learned how to use Jupyter notebooks, Python programming, Kepler data visualization tools, and other technical skills. But more broadly, they learned how to access and work with large datasets, formulate research questions, and think computationally, skills that are applicable to a wide range of fields from scientific research, technology, and finance to art and video game development.",33f716daa3a3ed6ae84d3b1b0cc33b5a072cd61e652c64d6bcbb8334d1492df0

The feedback that we got from the students was that they appreciated this approach as it helped them see how these skills could be a stepping stone to other questions they might have.” In their virtual classroom, students heard from field experts such as Brian Nord , Associate Scientist at Fermilab, and Charles Macal , Senior Technical Advisor & Social, Behavioral, and Decision Science Group Leader at Argonne, who introduced the students to scientific concepts such as artificial intelligence in astrophysics and agent-based modeling for predicting the path of epidemics. David Uminsky , executive director of data science initiatives at UChicago, explained the research lifecycle and used their own pre-workshop survey responses as the first dataset they encountered, while Dylan Halpern of the Center for Spatial Data Science covered visualizing data and the overlaps between art and science. But significantly, these sessions were equal parts scientific talk and open discussion of how each speaker found their way to a career in data science.

It’s important for people early on to get glimpses of what different careers and work lives look like. I hope they took away from our conversation that there are lots of ways to be a scientist in the world, and that they have people rooting for them, and we’re here for them when they need us.” The message was reinforced by talks from Brian McCallister, Assistant Director of Admissions at UChicago who outlined the college admissions process, and Ashlyn Sparrow , Assistant Director of the Weston Game Lab at UChicago. Sparrow’s talk, in particular, resonated with students, who heard about careers in game design and how crafting games relates to research, computing, data, and creativity. “It was actually really fun,” said Aijah Welch, a freshman at Hyde Park Academy. “We learned what it was like to be a mayor for a day.

The students split into two groups — named for computing pioneer Grace Hopper and NASA legend Katherine Johnson — and worked throughout the week with data ranging from John Snow’s seminal 1854 cholera map to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, breaking down how the virus affected communities across Chicago. The groups compared majority white, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods by their COVID-19 rates, and broke down case numbers by job types, revealing relationships between economics, race, and susceptibility to infection. The projects were more meaningful, the students said, because they were studying their own communities, allowing them to see the real people and the true impact behind the numbers. “It was something that we could relate to, something that was going on in real time,” said Daniel Neibel-Spruill, a sophomore at Kenwood Academy. “We could see what was going on, and it wasn’t just something made up for an exercise.” Perhaps because of the immediacy, the Data4All students have continued to use the skills acquired during the workshop on personal projects in the weeks since.",1df06edbbb52f8b8cf2420df0c052add3b87bab7d80222b5fc8a0de1dd08393b

Welch has taken her new knowledge back to her computer science course, where she is building a website about food for the final project. And while both students remain undecided about pursuing data science as a career, they feel that the ability to work with data will come in handy for whatever career path they choose. That’s the lasting effect that the workshop organizers hoped for: giving students the tools to realize their dreams, no matter what pathway they choose. For Argonne, this program aligns well with their emerging Argonne in Chicago Initiative. “There are amazing people that live on the South Side, and we’re just hoping to connect with them and tap into this immense potential,” said Meridith Brouzas , Manager of Educational Programs and Outreach at Argonne. “Working with these young people, it gives you more faith and confidence in our future.

The Data4All High School Bridge Workshop (Data4All) is on a mission to do just that by introducing high school students in the Chicagoland area to data science within a framework of scientific reasoning. In November, Data4All completed its sixth program cycle, engaging 30 high school students from across the City of Chicago in eight weeks of instruction. Since its launch in the spring of 2021, Data4All has successfully engaged a total of 138 students from 47 high schools. Data4All helps students grow in their data science skills and transition from introductory classes to data science research. The workshop introduces students to the data science research lifecycle, shares essential computational skills needed for analysis and visualization, and provides training on how to communicate their findings. Using public health case studies and real-world data sets, students apply statistical analysis and computational problem solving while learning Python, a widely-used programming language. While engaging in project-based learning, students also expand their understanding of data science careers and educational pathways through interactive guest lectures.

This fall, five UChicago college students worked alongside Data4All participants supporting their learning and social interactions. When asked about his experience as an undergraduate mentor, UChicago student Yannick Tanyi shared, “The most rewarding part of being a mentor has been seeing the transformation in the students’ attitudes and engagement— watching them dive into the activities, collaborate with each other, and truly enjoy what they’re learning has been incredibly fulfilling.” While many data science courses and bootcamps emphasize technical upskilling by teaching statistical concepts and coding, Data4All takes this a step further by situating these topics within the context of scientific inquiry.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2021 from Tel Aviv University under the supervision of Daniel Cohen-Or and Raja Giryes . My research is focused on building artificial intelligence for 3D data, spanning the fields of computer graphics, machine learning, and computer vision. Deep learning, the most popular form of artificial intelligence, has unlocked remarkable success on structured data (such as text, images, and video), and I am interested in harnessing the potential of these techniques to enable effective operation on unstructured 3D geometric data. We have developed a convolutional neural network designed specifically for meshes , and also explored how to learn from the internal data within a single shape (for surface reconstruction , geometric texture synthesis , and point cloud consolidation ) – and I am interested in broader applications related to these areas. Additional research directions that I am aiming to explore include: intertwining human and machine-based creativity to advance our capabilities in 3D shape modeling and animation; learning with less supervision, for example to extract patterns and relationships from large shape collections; and making 3D neural networks more “interpretable/explainable”.",cd9bf581dfb86e1ed182e2ad24063fdeac5df46eb7c6d78368eb1dbeb478af46

She develops computational methods to make sense of large amounts of genomic and other high-dimensional data to make discoveries that can be translated into improving human health. To translate GWAS findings into actionable target genes, she developed and implemented an approach that uses genotype data to predict gene expression levels. The resulting system, a first-in-class gene-based association method called PrediXcan, expanded the test unit from genetic variants to more biologically meaningful units such as genes. Her publication of PrediXcan inspired similar approaches, creating a new class of methods now known as TWAS.
